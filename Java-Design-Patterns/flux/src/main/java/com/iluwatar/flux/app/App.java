/**
 * 
 * Flux is the application architecture that Facebook uses for building client-side web 
 * applications. Flux eschews MVC in favor of a unidirectional data flow. When a user interacts with 
 * a React view, the view propagates an action through a central dispatcher, to the various stores that 
 * hold the application's data and business logic, which updates all of the views that are affected.  
 * 
 * This example has two views: menu and content. They represent typical main menu and content area of
 * a web page. When menu item is clicked it triggers events through the dispatcher. The events are
 * received and handled by the stores updating their data as needed. The stores then notify the views
 * that they should rerender themselves.
