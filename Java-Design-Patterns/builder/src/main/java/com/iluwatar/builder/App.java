 * 
 * This is the Builder pattern variation as described by Joshua Bloch in
 * Effective Java 2nd Edition.
 * 
 * We want to build Hero objects, but its construction is complex because of the
 * many parameters needed. To aid the user we introduce HeroBuilder class.
 * HeroBuilder takes the minimum parameters to build Hero object in its
 * constructor. After that additional configuration for the Hero object can be
 * done using the fluent HeroBuilder interface. When configuration is ready the
 * build method is called to receive the final Hero object.
