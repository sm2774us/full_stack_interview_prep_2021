AngularJS Authentication
=======================

The original application was updated to use MongoDb instead of Entity Framework.

The code was also cleaned up and got some Autofac treatment.

The angular app is untouched, just the credit was updated. ;-)

Nuget Package Restore is was also enabled and the whole project is running on the latest Nuget stable packages.
