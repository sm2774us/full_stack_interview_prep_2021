REST
====

A Simple REST framework based around a simple server that internally uses the HttpListener to provide the server side REST functions to clients

Here are some key points

1. Multithreaded server
2. Simple handler like REST endpoint handler (Verb based or custom routes via attributes)
3. JSON or XML serialization
4. Custom handlers have a choice of Task<T> or just T
5. .NET client tools to drastically simplify calling of REST endpoint
