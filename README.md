#### A: 10 Typical Html Exercises
##### Q1. Markup validation
Consider the following markup:
```html
<figure>
   <picture>
      <source media="(min-width: 40em)"
      srcset="large.jpg 1024w, medium.jpg 640w, small.jpg 320y">
      <img src="medium.jpg" alt="London by night">
   </picture>
   <figcaption>A landscape of London by night</figcaption>
</figure>
```
Is it valid? If not, can you explain why?
##### A1.
The markup uses [the picture element](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-picture-element/), which is a pretty new addition to the specification.
The code is all valid apart from the last image specified in the `srcset` attribute; `320y` isnâ€™t a valid value.
If the `y` is replaced with a `w`, it becomes valid though.
