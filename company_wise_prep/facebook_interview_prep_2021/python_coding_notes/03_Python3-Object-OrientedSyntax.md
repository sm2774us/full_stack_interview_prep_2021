## 1. Introduction <a name="1"></a>

Object-Oriented Programming. Pretty standard, good vibes. :)

Why Object-Oriented though? It's good to model programming structures like how real world objects are like! Real world objects have properties (colour, height, etc.) and abilities (run, walk, swim)! 

Python 3 objects have Attributes/Properties and Methods! These are collectively known as the Members of an object!

> The basis for all object oriented programming languages is the manipulation of **objects**.
>
> **Objects** contain **Attributes** and **Methods**. These two can be referred to collectively as the **Members** of the **Object's Class**.



### 1.1 Objects and Classes <a name="1.1"></a>

[go to top](#top)

>  These subsections are pulled from my PHP OOP reference, but I'm including them here for convenience's sake 

**Objects** act a lot like real-world objects. They:

- Can be **created** or **destroyed**
- Are instances of **Classes**
- Have manipulable **Properties/Attributes**
- Have callable **Methods** (it's like calling functions!)

**Classes** define the **Attributes** and **Methods** of objects that belong to them! Attributes and Methods are referred collectively as the class' **Members**.

So for example, you can have a class that defines an object with the property: "Colour", but the instance of the class (the object), can have any value within that property (Red, Black, etc.) **You can also state the default value of the class otherwise!**

> **Example:** **methylDragon** is an object that belongs to the **Dragon** class. This gives him default attributes like:
>
> Color: Red
> Sound: ["Rawr"]  (This is an array because the object might make multiple sounds)
> Breath: Fire
>
> And methods like:
>
> Sound()
> Talk()
> Walk()
> Eat()
> Fly()
>
> **Note:** When constructing an object belonging to a class, you **can** override the default values defined by the class. So when defining **methylDragon**, you can give him alternative attribute values! Like the **Color: Black**!



### 1.2 Inheritance <a name="1.2"></a>

[go to top](#top)

Notably, **you can nest classes!** Sub-classes will then **inherit** or **overriding** the attributes and methods of their parent classes as a **polymorphism**.

> **Example:** The class **Dragon** has a child class (sub-class) **Music_Dragon** that **methylDragon** belongs to! 
>
> This can confer new methods or attributes (Like... A stage-name, and music making ability) **in addition** to any attributes and methods the **Dragon** class conferred.
>
> It can also override any pre-existing methods or attributes the defined objects would have had. So for example, Sound could be re-defined as containing ["Rawr", "~â™ª~â™«~â™ª~â™ª"] by default instead!
>
> So now **methylDragon** has the following:
>
> Attributes:
>
> Color: Black | (<u>Custom defined</u>)    
> Sound: ["Rawr", "~â™ª~â™«~â™ª~â™ª"] | (<u>Overridden</u>)    
> Breath: Fire | (<u>Inherited</u>)    
>
> Methods:
>
> Sound() | (<u>Overridden</u>)    
> Talk() | (<u>Inherited</u>)    
> Walk() | (<u>Inherited</u>)    
> Eat() | (<u>Inherited</u>)    
> Fly() | (<u>Inherited</u>)



### 1.3 Polymorphisms <a name="1.3"></a>

[go to top](#top)

You can override pre-existing methods defined by a parent class. This means that when the method is called, the child class' method definition will be used instead of the parent class'.

> **Example:** The **Music_Dragon** class defines an alternate version of the Sound() method that allows objects belonging it to also make music!
>
> So **methylDragon** can make music! ðŸŽµ

## 2. Object-Oriented Python 3 Syntax Reference <a name="2"></a>

### 2.1 Visibility <a name="2.1"></a>

Let's get some pre-requisites refreshed or out of the way.

If this tutorial's going too fast for you, go brush up on some OOP concepts. I treated the subject fairly well in the Object-Oriented PHP reference.

```python
# Visibility refresher

public:
# Public methods and attributes can be accessed and changed by:
# - any class

private:
# Private methods and attributes can only be accessed and changed by:
# - the same class that declared it

protected:
# Protected methods and attributes can be accessed and changed by:
# - the same class that declared it
# - any child classes (that inherit from the class the protected data is declared in)

# NOTE: Visibility affects inheritance as well! Private attributes and methods are NOT inherited
```

In Python 3,

- Public elements are defined by default. Just write the element name and you've set it as public! `element_name`
- Private elements are defined by preceding the element name with two underscores `__element_name`
- Protected elements are defined by preceding the element name with one underscore `_element_name`


> Ok, actually this is **TECHNICALLY NOT TRUE. (Python doesn't have a privacy model.)** But it's good practice to pretend that it is.
>
> \_\_element_name will behave like a private element at the outset, but that's because Python will mangle the name into \_parent\_\_element_name. It's technically still available for use, but we can just assume no sane person would actually do it. (... Although)
>
> _element_name is just conventionally taken to be 'private', but we can just take it to be 'protected', since children will inherit it.

### 2.2 Class Definition <a name="2.2"></a>

[go to top](#top)

Let's define a Class! Class objects are templates that objects are instances of.

So for example, you can have an Animal class which defines common properties and methods that every animal should have. But an individual animal will just be an instance of this class (that can have different values in those properties!)

```python
class Animal:
    # We're defining properties here! Think of them as class specific variables!
    # These are the default values that instances of the class (objects) are initiated with
    
    # Since we stated them without self. ,
    # These variables are STATIC! I.e. they're tied to the class and not the class instances
    number_of_animals = 0

    # Ok! Time to define methods! Think of them as class specific functions!

    # Define a constructor method that runs each time a new instance of the class is instantiated
    def __init__(self, name, height, weight, sound):
        # Initialise all the properties as input
        # We're setting these as protected because we want sub-classes to inherit them
        self._name = name
        self._height = height
        self._weight = weight
        self._sound = sound
        
        # Increment the static variable class counter
        Animal.number_of_animals += 1

    # Define setter methods (methods that set object properties)
    def set_name(self, name): # Self refers to the instance of the class when the method is called!
        self._name = name

    # You could go on to define the rest of them for the rest of the properties
    # I won't though

    # Define getter methods (methods that set object properties)
    def get_name(self): # Because the name is private
        return self._name
    
    def get_sound(self):
        return self._sound

    # Same here

    # One more method here:
    def get_type(self):
        print("Animal")

    # This method defines what happens when you print the object!
    def __str__(self):
        return "{} is {} cm tall, {} kg and says {}".format(self._name,
                                                              self._height,
                                                              self._weight,
                                                              self._sound)
```

```python
# Cool! Now let's make some objects!
cat = Animal("Cate", 33, 10, "Meow")

print(cat) # Prints: Cate is 33 cm tall and 10 kg and says Meow

# You can call an object's methods like so
print(cat.get_name()) # Prints: Cate
```



### 2.3 Child Class Definition <a name="2.3"></a>

[go to top](#top)

Note: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/860339/difference-between-private-public-and-protected-inheritance

> ```
> Member in base class : Private   Protected   Public   
> ```
>
> **Inheritance type**  :             **Object inherited as**:

> ```
> Private            :   Inaccessible   Private     Private   
> Protected          :   Inaccessible   Protected   Protected  
> Public             :   Inaccessible   Protected   Public
> ```

```python
# Let's make a child class that inherits from Animal!

class Dragon(Animal): # The bracket makes Dragon a subclass of Animal
    _breath = ""
    
    def __init__(self, name, height, weight, sound, breath):
        self._breath = breath
        # The super keyword lets the parent/superclass handle what you tell it to!
        super(Dragon, self).__init__(name, height, weight, sound)
        
        # You COULD also write it this way, but it means remembering the name of the parent class
        # Animal.__init__(self, name, height, weight, sound)
        
    def set_breath(self, breath):
        self._breath = breath
        
    def get_breath(self):
        return self._breath
    
    # These are different from those in Animal! They're 'polymorphisms' that overwrite the
    # implementation in the parent class!
    def get_type(self):
        print("Dragon")

    def __str__(self):
        return "{} is {} cm tall, {} kg, says {}, and breathes {}".format(self._name,
                                                                            self._height,
                                                                            self._weight,
                                                                            self._sound,
                                                                            self._breath)
    
    # Let's go through method overloading also
    
    # Which is a way for you to let methods behave differently depending on the inputs
    # There's no inbuilt way to do this in Python, but you can get around it with default arguments
    def multiple_sounds(self, times = None):
        if times is None:
            print(self.get_sound())
            return
            # Note that this works because get_sound is implemented in the parent class, Animal!
        else:
            print(self.get_sound(),str(times),"times!")
```

```python
# Let's make a dragon! (Properties stated not representative of the actual methylDragon)
methylDragon = Dragon("methylDragon", 201, 80, "Rawr", "The Breath Of Song")

print(methylDragon)
# Prints: methylDragon is 201 cm tall, 80 kg, says Rawr, and breathes The Breath Of Song

# Let's test our overloaded method!
methylDragon.multiple_sounds() # Prints: Rawr
methylDragon.multiple_sounds(2) # Prints: Rawr 2 times!

# Ok, remember our static number_of_animals variable?
print(methylDragon.number_of_animals) # Prints: 2
print(cat.number_of_animals) # Prints: 2 ! Cool huh!
```



### 2.4 Useful Class-Related Operators <a name="2.4"></a>

[go to top](#top)

#### **isinstance()**

Check to see if something is an instance of a class (child class instances are also instances of the parent/base class!)

Specifically, if an **object** is an instance of a **class**

This is known as an is-a relationship!

```python
# Syntax: isinstance(object, baseclass)

# Let's say we have the Dragon class defined before (with Animal)
methylDragon = Dragon("methylDragon", 201, 80, "rawr", "The Breath Of Song")

# methylDragon is an instance of the Dragon class
isinstance(methylDragon, Dragon) # True

# Which is also a child class of the Animal parent class! So he's also an instance of Animal
isinstance(methylDragon, Animal) # True


# The alternative is to do this:
# But why would you
if str(type(object)) == "<class 'instance'>":
    print("True")
else:
    print("False")
```

#### **issubclass()**

Check to see if something is an instance of a class (child class instances are also instances of the parent/base class!)

Specifically, if an **class** is a subclass of a **class**

This is known as the base class having a has-a relationship! (Animals have Dragons included!)

```python
# Syntax: issubclass(class, baseclass)

methylDragon = Dragon("methylDragon", 201, 80, "rawr", "The Breath Of Song")

# methylDragon IS NOT A CLASS! He's an instance of Dragon!
isinstance(methylDragon, Dragon) # ERROR!

# Dragon is a sub-class of Animal!
isinstance(Dragon, Animal) # True
```



### 2.4 Polymorphisms <a name="2.4"></a>

[go to top](#top)

> There's no such thing as an explicitly Virtual Method in Python (ala C++), because everything is duck typed. So I won't talk about virtual methods here (check my C++ OOP reference if you want to know more about it!.) If you REALLY wanted to use them though, check the `abc` (abstract class) module.

Did you notice something back in section 2.2? There were different implementations of the get_type method!

```python
# Animal

def get_type(self):
    print("Animal")

# Dragon

def get_type(self):
    print("Dragon")
```

Sure enough, if you call them

```python
cat = Animal("Cate", 33, 10, "Meow")
methylDragon = Dragon("methylDragon", 201, 80, "Rawr", "The Breath Of Song")

cat.get_type() # Prints: Animal
methylDragon.get_type() # Prints: Dragon

# This is the gist of what polymorphisms are!
# Methods with the same name, but with different implementations!
```



### 2.5 Magic Methods <a name="2.5"></a>

[go to top](#top)

You might have noticed that the methods like `__init__(self)` `__str__(self)`, etc. seem kinda special.

That's because they are! They're part of a group of pre-defined methods called **magic methods**.

There's one more I'd like to tell you about, but the rest of them are here: https://rszalski.github.io/magicmethods/

```python
# If __init__(self) is the constructor method
# __del__(self) is the destructor! It gets called each time an object is uninstantiated/destroyed

def __del__(self):
    print("Object being destroyed")
    
# MORE MAGIC METHODS
# Let's say we have two objects: ob1 and ob2
# We can define with MAGIC METHODS what happens when you...
# ob1 + ob2
# ob1 - ob2
# ob1 == ob2
# ob1 * ob2
# ob1(blahblah) <-- Like a function!
# so on and so forth!
# More or less every basic operation has one for it... Here are just a few!

# These magic methods are callbacks for when you...

# Add the object
def __add__(self,other): # Other is the object that you're subtracting from! (ob2)
    
# Subtract the object
def __sub__(self,other):
    
# Multiply the object
def __mul__(self,other):
    
# Call the object (like a function!)
def __call__(self, *INPUTS):
    
# Equating objects
def __eq__(self, other):
```



#### **\_\_slots\_\_**

This particular magic method is pretty nifty for defining classes that are meant to be used as objects.

Suppose we created a cartesian point class.

```python
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
```

Since Python stores class attributes as dictionaries by default (base dictionaries have 288 bytes allocated to them), there's a pretty significant optimisation we can do. And this is done by using slots to change the way Python tracks the attributes to using tuples (48 bytes), or something else, like a list.

**This stops you from dynamically creating attributes**, but saves a ton of space, which is very important if you intend on instantiating a lot of instances of this class.

```python
# Set slots as tuple
# Makes reassigning x and y impossible
class Point:
    __slots__ = ('x', 'y')
    
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        
# Set slots as list
# More overhead, but mutable
class Point:
    __slots__ = ['x', 'y']

    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
```



### 2.6 Generating Multiple Objects at a Time <a name="2.6"></a>

[go to top](#top)

Let's say you're lazy and you want to make multiple objects without having to type them out one by one.

#### **Use a list comprehension and make them in a list!**

```python
objs = [my_class() for i in range(10)]
for obj in objs:
    other_object.append(obj)

objs[0].do_sth()
```

```python
# Here's a more fleshed out example

from math import sqrt

class Coordinate:
    x = 0
    y = 0

def area_of_triangle(p1,p2,p3):
    side = lambda a, b : sqrt((b.x-a.x)**2  + (b.y-a.y)**2)
    side_one = side(p1,p2)
    side_two = side(p2,p3)
    side_three = side(p3,p1)
    s = (side_one + side_two + side_three)/2
    area = sqrt(s*(s-side_one)*(s-side_two)*(s-side_three))
    return round(area,2)

points = list() # Generate a list for Coordinate objects

for num in range(3):
    points.append(Coordinate()) # Create a new Coordinate object and append it to the list
    # Set Coordinate parameters
    points[num].x = float(input(f"Enter x coordinate of the #{num+1} point of a triangle: "))
    points[num].y = float(input(f"Enter y coordinate of the #{num+1} point of a triangle: "))

print("Area of triangle:",area_of_triangle(points[0],points[1],points[2]))
```

#### **Or a dictionary comprehension!**

```python
class my_class:
   def __init__(self, name):
       self.name = name

instance_names = ['Steven', 'Bob', 'Sophie']

# Dictionary!
objects = {name: my_class(name=name) for name in instance_names}

# Access as such
print(objects["Steven"].name) # Prints "Steven"
```



### 2.7 Encapsulation, Getters, Setters, and Property() <a name="2.7"></a>

[go to top](#top)

Recall our Animal and Dragon classes. Ever wondered why we set their attributes as protected?

This is a concept known as **encapsulation**, which is a good programming practice, allowing you to separate an object's behaviour from its implementation (i.e. hiding away internal data and protecting it from being messed around with by clients.)

Because the attributes are protected, we need to define **getter** and **setter** methods, which are public methods that can access them!

Consider this class

```python
class Celsius:  
    def __init__(self, temperature = 0):
        self._temperature = temperature
    
    # Getter method
    def get_temperature(self):
        return self._temperature
    
    # Setter method
    def set_temperature(self, temperature):
        if temperature < -273:
            temperature = -273
        self._temperature = temperature
```
#### **Property()**

It can be annoying to have to deal with remembering the getters and setters! Luckily, Python has a neat trick that allows you to access them as you would public attributes, but still get the benefits of encapsulation!

You do this by defining a public interface to the attribute using the property() function!

```python
class Celsius:  
    def __init__(self, temperature = 0):
        self._temperature = temperature
    
    # Getter method
    def get_temperature(self):
        return self._temperature
    
    # Setter method
    def set_temperature(self, temperature):
        if temperature < -273:
            temperature = -273
        self._temperature = temperature
  
    temperature = property(get_temperature, set_temperature)
```

The general way to write a property() call is as such

```python
<attribute> = property(getter_method, setter_method, deleter_method, "DOC_STRING")
```

With this, we can access the temperature class' attributes like this!

```python
temp = Celsius()

# Before, you needed to do it via
temp.get_temperature() # Get
temp.set_temperature(20) # Set

# Now, you can do it like this! Notice how it's almost as if the attribute is now public?
temp.temperature # Get
temp.temperature = 50 # Set
```

#### **BONUS: Property() with Decorators!** (See advanced section for info about decorators)

```python
class Celsius:  
    def __init__(self, temperature = 0):
        self._temperature = temperature
    
    # Getter method
    @property # Here's the decorator!
    def temperature(self): # Notice the method name changed!
        return self._temperature

    # Setter method
    @temperature.setter # And here!
    def temperature(self, temperature): # Notice the method name changed!
        if temperature < -273:
            temperature = -273
        self._temperature = temperature
```



### 2.8 Modules and \_\_init\_\_.py <a name="2.8"></a>

[go to top](#top)

So we all know about the **import** statement. If you don't, uh.. Go back to part 1 and start again...?

It's a good way to literally import modules into your code, which you can treat (in a really handwavy fashion) as it just being a copy paste of the imported code at hand. In that way, you make the imported code (and any methods or variables) available to your code!

For example...

Test.py

```python
import test

print(test.raa) # Prints: "raa"
test.rawr() # Prints: "Rawr"
```

test_alt.py

```python
from test import raa, rawr

print(raa) # Prints: "raa"
rawr() # Prints: "Rawr"
```

my_module.py

```python
raa = "raa"

def rawr():
    print("Rawr")
```



#### **\_\_init\_\_.py**

That was cool! What if we wanted to have our module structured in directories?

Folder structure:

- my_script.py
- my_package
  - **\_\_init\_\_.py**  <----
  - module_file_1.py
  - module_file_2.py
  - ...

The first way you can initialise the module (which works even if your \_\_init\_\_.py file is **blank**) (given that the package is in PYTHONPATH) is to do this:

```python
import my_package.module_file_1

# or

from my_package import module_file_1
```

Notably, you **cannot import functions, only Python files!**

If you wanted to do that, **USE \_\_init\_\_.py**!

> On importing the package (`import my_package`), \_\_init\_\_.py will be run!

So you can do stuff like this

\_\_init\_\_.py (example)

```python
from module_file_1 import function_1, function_2
from module_file_2 import function_1, function_2

# While you could, try NOT to do this
# import module_file_1
# import module_file_2

# Be Pythonic! Be explicit!


# Maybe write some metadata? Version, author, release date, etc.
# Maybe some documentation? :)

...

# any other init stuff

# Maybe instantiate a class?
my_object = Some_Class()

# Maybe do something else?
```

Overall a pretty cool concept! Go forth and make your own modules!
