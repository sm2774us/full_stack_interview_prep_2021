				<li><span id="token1">[Parallel Time: 13.9 ms, GC Workers: 8]</span> - Indicating that for 13.9 ms (clock time) the following activities were carried out by 8 threads in parallel</li>
				<li><span id="token2"> [GC Worker Start (ms)</span> - The moment in time at which the workers started their activity, matching the timestamp at the beginning of the pause. If Min and Max differ a lot, then it may be an indication that too many threads are used or other processes on the machine are stealing CPU time from the garbage collection process inside the JVM</li>
				<li><span id="token3">[Ext Root Scanning (ms)</span> - How long it took to scan the external (non-heap) roots such as classloaders, JNI references, JVM system roots, etc. Shows elapsed time, “Sum” is CPU time</li>
				<li><span id="token4">[Code Root Scanning (ms)</span> - How long it took to scan the roots that came from the actual code: local vars, etc.</li>
				<li><span id="token5">[Object Copy (ms)</span> - How long it took to copy the live objects away from the collected regions.</li>
				<li><span id="token6">[Termination (ms)</span> - How long it took for the worker threads to ensure that they can safely stop and that there’s no more work to be done, and then actually terminate</li>
				<li><span id="token7">[Termination Attempts</span> - How many attempts worker threads took to try and terminate. An attempt is failed if the worker discovers that there’s in fact more work to be done, and it’s too early to terminate.</li>
				<li><span id="token8">[GC Worker Other (ms)</span> - Other miscellaneous small activities that do not deserve a separate section in the logs.</li>
				<li><span id="token9">GC Worker Total (ms)</span> - How long the worker threads have worked for in total</li>
				<li><span id="token10">[GC Worker End (ms)</span> - The timestamp at which the workers have finished their jobs. Normally they should be roughly equal, otherwise it may be an indication of too many threads hanging around or a noisy neighbor</li>
