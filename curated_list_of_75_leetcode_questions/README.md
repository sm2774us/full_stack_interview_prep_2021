#### [LC-12:Integer to Roman](https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-to-roman/)
##### Solution Explanation
```
Idea:

Just like Roman to Integer, this problem is most easily solved using a lookup table (dictionary) for the conversion between digit and numeral. 
In this case, we can easily deal with the values in descending order and insert the appropriate numeral (or numerals) 
as many times as we can while reducing the our target number (N) by the same amount.

Once N runs out, we can return ans.

#### [LC-13:Roman to Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/)
##### Solution Explanation
```
Approach:

Use dictionary for fast and easy lookup of numeral to integer value.
Go through each numeral in the input string
If numeral is smaller than the next numeral in the input we have a value like IV so subtract the current numeral from the next numeral.
Else add the value of the numeral to our result.

#### [LC-149:Max Points on a Line](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-points-on-a-line/)
##### The Math Behind the Solution
```
Q1> What is the equation of a line, in the form:
ax + by + c = 0, 
with gradient -2 through the point (4, -6) ?

A1> 
First, we should know that slope of linear equation is :
m = (y1 − y2)/(x1 − x2)
and we can form the equation by this formula.

In this case, we have gradient (slope) = −2 and the 
point (4, -6).
We can just simply substitute the things we know into 
the above equation.

So, the equation will be:
−2 = (y − (−6)) / (x − 4)
−2(x − 4) = y + 6
−2x + 8 = y + 6

And we can change it in the form ax + by + c = 0, which is
−2x −y + 2 = 0

Q2> Finding a linear equation ax + by + c = 0 given 2 points ?

A2>
If you have 2 points, for example:

P( 2, 1 ); Q( 5, 7 )

You can find the linear equation of the line that passes through those points in the form:

Ax + By + C = 0

in one step by simply using the formula:

(y1 – y2)x + (x2 – x1)y + (x1y2 – x2y1) = 0

OR, we can write this as (easier to read!)
(py – qy)x + (qx – px)y + (px*qy – qx*py) = 0

Let’s try it:

Take Point1=( 2, 1 )
Take Point2=( 5, 7 )

Find the LINEAR EQUATION of the line that passes through the points (2,1) and (5,7). Your answer must be in the form of Ax + By + C = 0.

Using the equation:
(y1 – y2)x + (x2 – x1)y + (x1*y2 – x2*y1) = 0

We’ll just plug numbers in:
(1 – 7)x + (5 – 2)y + ( (2 x 7) – (5 x 1) ) = 0
-6x + 3y + (14 – 5) = 0
-6x + 3y + 9 = 0

Factoring a -3 out:
-3( 2x – y – 3 ) = 0

Dividing both sides by -3:
2x – y – 3 = 0

And that’s the answer.
```
##### Solution Explanation
```
1) Remember from Euclidean Geometry that the general equation of a line is represented as: 
ax + by + c = 0
or
ax + by = c

2) if x1 == x2:
equation: x = x1
       o: a, b, c = 1, 0, -x1

3) Not using usual linear equation y = kx + b
because of the precision problem of float.
We need to make sure all numbers are integer
so use ax + by + c = 0 instead
values of a, b, c can be deduced from the following simultaneous equations:
3.1) ax1 + by1 + c = 0
3.2) ax2 + by2 + c = 0
Using basic algebra, we get:
3.3) a/b = (y1-y2)/(x2-x1), set a to y1-y2, b to x2-x1
Substitute a and b into the previous simultaneous equations
we get:
3.4) c = x1y2-x2y1

4)
To make sure the same (a, b, c) are calculated for all
same lines. We need to set some rules. Because values of
a and b are only bounded by a ratio (eq 2), and a and b
are picked arbitrarily.

  first: make sure a is positive
 reason: -ax - by - c = 0 represents the same line
     as: ax + by + c = 0

 second: reduce fraction of a, b and c
 reason: 2ax + 2by + 2c = 0 represents the same line
     as: ax + by + c = 0				

a, b, c = y1 - y2, x2 - x1, x1 * y2 - x2 * y1

5) get gcd of a, b and c

6) reduce fraction

7) handle edge case: return 0 for 0 point, 1 for 1 point

8) get max on the length of values (x and y coordinates of each point that constitutes a line) in the result dictionary -> pointsInLine 
   and that is your answer
```

#### [LC-204:Count Primes](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-primes/)
##### The Math Behind the Solution
```
Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes

In mathematics, the sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit.

A prime number is a natural number that has exactly two distinct natural number divisors: the number 1 and itself.

To find all the prime numbers less than or equal to a given integer n by Eratosthenes' method:

  1. Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 through n: (2, 3, 4, ..., n).
  2. Initially, let p equal 2, the smallest prime number.
  3. Enumerate the multiples of p by counting in increments of p from 2p to n, and mark them in the list (these will be 2p, 3p, 4p, ...; the p itself should not be marked).
  4. Find the smallest number in the list greater than p that is not marked. If there was no such number, stop. Otherwise, let p now equal this new number (which is the next prime), and repeat from step 3.
  5. When the algorithm terminates, the numbers remaining not marked in the list are all the primes below n.
  6. The main idea here is that every value given to p will be prime, because if it were composite it would be marked as a multiple of some other, smaller prime. Note that some of the numbers may be marked more than once (e.g., 15 will be marked both for 3 and 5).

As a refinement, it is sufficient to mark the numbers in step 3 starting from p2, as all the smaller multiples of p will have already been marked at that point. This means that the algorithm is allowed to terminate in step 4 when p2 is greater than n.[1]

Another refinement is to initially list odd numbers only, (3, 5, ..., n), and count in increments of 2p from p2 in step 3, thus marking only odd multiples of p. This actually appears in the original algorithm.[1] This can be generalized with wheel factorization, forming the initial list only from numbers coprime with the first few primes and not just from odds (i.e., numbers coprime with 2), and counting in the correspondingly adjusted increments so that only such multiples of p are generated that are coprime with those small primes, in the first place.[6]
-------------------------
Example
To find all the prime numbers less than or equal to 30, proceed as follows.

First, generate a list of integers from 2 to 30:
```
> 2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30
```
The first number in the list is 2; cross out every 2nd number in the list after 2 by counting up from 2 in increments of 2 (these will be all the multiples of 2 in the list):
```
> 2  3  ~~4~~  5  ~~6~~  7  ~~8~~  9  ~~10~~ 11 ~~12~~ 13 ~~14~~ 15 ~~16~~ 17 ~~18~~ 19 ~~20~~ 21 ~~22~~ 23 ~~24~~ 25 ~~26~~ 27 ~~28~~ 29 ~~30~~
```
The next number in the list after 2 is 3; cross out every 3rd number in the list after 3 by counting up from 3 in increments of 3 (these will be all the multiples of 3 in the list):
```
> 2  3  ~~4~~  5  ~~6~~  7  ~~8  9  10~~ 11 ~~12~~ 13 ~~14 15 16~~ 17 ~~18~~ 19 ~~20 21 22~~ 23 ~~24~~ 25 ~~26 27 28~~ 29 ~~30~~
```
The next number not yet crossed out in the list after 3 is 5; cross out every 5th number in the list after 5 by counting up from 5 in increments of 5 (i.e. all the multiples of 5):
```
> 2  3  ~~4~~  5  ~~6~~  7  ~~8  9  10~~ 11 ~~12~~ 13 ~~14 15 16~~ 17 ~~18~~ 19 ~~20 21 22~~ 23 ~~24 25 26 27 28~~ 29 ~~30~~
```
The next number not yet crossed out in the list after 5 is 7; the next step would be to cross out every 7th number in the list after 7, but they are all already crossed out at this point, as these numbers (14, 21, 28) are also multiples of smaller primes because 7 × 7 is greater than 30. The numbers not crossed out at this point in the list are all the prime numbers below 30:
```
> 2  3     5     7           11    13          17    19          23                29
```
-------------------------
Pseudocode
-------------------------
The sieve of Eratosthenes can be expressed in pseudocode, as follows:
```
> algorithm Sieve of Eratosthenes is
>     input: an integer n > 1.
>     output: all prime numbers from 2 through n.
> 
>     let A be an array of Boolean values, indexed by integers 2 to n,
>     initially all set to true.
>     
>     for i = 2, 3, 4, ..., not exceeding √n do
>         if A[i] is true
>             for j = i2, i2+i, i2+2i, i2+3i, ..., not exceeding n do
>                 A[j] := false
> 
>     return all i such that A[i] is true.
> 
```
This algorithm produces all primes not greater than n. It includes a common optimization, which is to start enumerating t
he multiples of each prime i from i^2. The time complexity of this algorithm is O( N* Log(Log(N)) ),
provided the array update is an O(1) operation, as is usually the case.
```

##### Solution Explanation
```
Algorithm:
-------------------------------
  1. Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 through n: (2, 3, 4, ..., n).
  2. Initially, let p equal 2, the smallest prime number.
  3. Enumerate the multiples of p by counting in increments of p from 2p to n, and mark them in the list (these will be 2p, 3p, 4p, ...; the p itself should not be marked).
  4. Find the smallest number in the list greater than p that is not marked. If there was no such number, stop. Otherwise, let p now equal this new number (which is the next prime), and repeat from step 3.
  5. When the algorithm terminates, the numbers remaining not marked in the list are all the primes below n.
  6. The main idea here is that every value given to p will be prime, because if it were composite it would be marked as a multiple of some other, smaller prime. Note that some of the numbers may be marked more than once (e.g., 15 will be marked both for 3 and 5).

Make your code faster:
-------------------------------
  * The code line:
    
	lst[m * m: n: m] = [0] *((n-m*m-1)//m + 1) 
	
	is key to reduce the run time.
	You could write a loop like this (but it would be very expensive):
	
    for i in range(m * m, n,  m):
        lst[i] = 0

  * After marking all the even indices in the first iteration, I do not check even numbers again, 
    and will only check odd numbers in the remaining iterations.

  * I created a list with numeral elements, instead of boolean elements.
  
  * Do not use function sqrt, because it is expensive [do not use: m < sqrt(n)].
    Instead, use: m * m < n.
```
##### Complexity Analysis

TC: O( N* Log(Log(N)) )

The time complexity is O(n/2 + n/3 + n/5 + n/7 + n/11 + ....) which is equivalent to O( N* Log(Log(N)) ).

            if lst[m] == 1:    ###// if m is already marked by 0, no need to check its multiples.
			
			    ###// If m is marked by 1, we mark all its multiples from m * m to n by 0. 
			    ###// 1 + (n - m * m - 1) // m is equal to the number of multiples of m from m * m to n
                lst[m * m: n: m] = [0] *(1 + (n - m * m - 1) // m)
				
			###// If it is the first iteration (e.g. m = 2), add 1 to m (e.g. m = m + 1; 
			### // which means m will be 3 in the next iteration), 
            ###// otherwise: (m = m + 2); This way we avoid checking even numbers again.

##### Approach-2 ( Modular Exponentiation ).
##### Solution Explanation
```
i)   It's useful in the field of public-key cryptography, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_exponentiation
ii)  c mod m = (a * b) mod m = [(a mod m) * (b mod m)] mod m
iii) Starting from the front, we do the powMod the base with the corresponding digit
iv)  Then, we need to remember to powMod the previous result with 10

pow_mod is quite similar to ordinary pow except computing remainder instead of product. 
Since b could be larger than 2^31 so superPow is added.
Otherwise pow_mod(a, c) is enough with O(lgN), 
where N is the value of c.
Inside superPow, I only call pow_mod(a, 10) with O(1). So the overall time complexity is O(N), 
where N is the length of b.

#### [LC-509:Fibonacci Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/)
##### Approach-1 ( Using Binet's Formula or the Golden Ratio  ).

##### The Math Behind the Solution
* Calculating terms of the Fibonacci sequence can be tedious when using the recursive formula, especially when finding terms with a large n. 
* Luckily, a mathematician named Leonhard Euler discovered a formula for calculating any Fibonacci number.
* This formula was lost for about 100 years and was rediscovered by another mathematician named Jacques Binet.
* The original formula, known as Binet’s formula, is shown below :
* **Binet’s Formula**: The nth Fibonacci number is given by the following formula:
![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{150}%20f_{n}=\frac{\left[\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^{n}-\left(\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^{n}\right]}{\sqrt{5}})

* Another interesting fact arises when looking at the ratios of consecutive Fibonacci numbers.
* It appears that these ratios are approaching a number.
* The number that these ratios are getting closer to is a special number called the Golden Ratio which is denoted by  (the Greek letter phi). You have seen this number in Binet’s formula.
* The Golden Ratio:
![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{150}%20\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2})
* The Golden Ratio has the decimal approximation of ϕ =1.6180339887.

                return fib_helper(n-1, b, a+b)
        
        return fib_helper(n)
```

##### Approach-3 ( Using Matrix Exponentiation - DP ).

##### Solution Explanation
```
Usually if any problem is solvable in constant space using iterative dp,
then we can apply matrix exponentiation and convert an O(n) problem to O(logn)

We will try to create a matrix out of the recursive relations we know:

Relation 1:      fib(n)   =   1*fib(n-1) +  1*fib(n-2)
Relation 2:      fib(n-1) =   1*fib(n-1) +  0*fib(n-2)

Matrix M:  [1,1]
           [1,0]
				  
|fib (n) | =   |1 1| |fib(n-1)|
|fib(n-1)|     |1 0| |fib(n-2)|

or 

|fib (n) |  =  |1 1| |1 1||fib(n-2)|
|fib(n-1)|     |1 0| |1 0||fib(n-3)|

or

|fib (n) |  =  |1 1| |1 1| |1 1||fib(n-3)|
|fib(n-1)|     |1 0| |1 0| |1 0||fib(n-4)|

or

|fib (n) |  =  |1 1| ^ (n-2) |fib(2)|
|fib(n-1)|     |1 0|         |fib(1)|
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Intuition
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The core idea behind this is to evaluate the equation F[n] = F[n-1] + F[n-2] 
and represent this as somehow a power of a matrix. 
We know that a^n can be calculated in O(log n) time using binary exponentiation.
If we can somehow represent the above recurrence relation as a power of matrix and the base values (F[1], F[0]),
then we can get the F[n] in O(log n) time.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Algorithm
---------------------------------------------------------------------
So consider this :- [F[n], F[n-1]] = [[1,1], [1,0]] * [F[n-1], F[n-2]].
So what I have done is just make the matrix on the right side a 2 X 1 matrix 
so that it can be represented in the terms of this matrix [[1,1],[1,0]]. 
This is done because if you see the left side, then you can put 
[F[n-1], F[n-2]] = [[1,1],[1,0]] * [F[n-2],F[n-3]]. 

So you if you keep doing this then the above recurrence relation boils down to
[F[n], F[n-1]] = [[1,1], [1,0]] ^ (n-1) * [F[1], F[0]].

So what we have to do is calculate the (n-1)th power of the matrix [[1,1],[1,0]]. 
So we can calculate that just like we calculate the a^n in O(log n) time using binary exponentiation.
Just that a would be the matrix [[1,1],[1,0]] instead of an integer.
Following is the code for this :-

#### [LC-1390:Four Divisors](https://leetcode.com/problems/four-divisors/)

##### Approach-1 ( Sieve of Eratosthenes ).
##### Solution Explanation
```
Based on the property of prime number to count the divisors:

n = p1 ^ (a1) * p2 ^ (a2) *... * pn ^ (an) ; (with p1,p2,..,pn is the prime)

= > the total divisors of number S = (a1+1) * (a2 + 1) * .. *(an +1)

***So if one number have 4 divisors we have 2 cases:

case 1: S = (a1+1) = (3 + 1) = 4 -> N = p1^3

case 2: S = (a1+1) * (a2 + 1) = 2 * 2 = 4 -> N = p1 ^ 1 * p2 ^ 1 ; (with p1,p2 is prime and p2!=p1 )
```
##### Complexity Analysis
```
Time  : O(N+K*log(log(K)))  where N = max(nums), K is len(primes) 
Space : O(N+M+K^2)          where N = max(nums), M=len(nums), K is len(primes) 
```
```python
class Solution:
	def sieve(self, n):
		mark = [True] * (n + 1)
		mark[0] = False
		mark[1] = False
		for i in range(2, int(n **(0.5)) + 2):
			for j in range(i*i, n + 1, i):
				mark[j]  = False
		return mark

		def f(num, mark):

					return s + i + num//i
				if(num % i == 0):
					s += i
					num = num//i
					if(mark[num] == True and num!=i):  # case 2 : n = p1 ^ 1 * p2 ^ 1 -> the "p2" must be prime and different with the "p1" 
						return s + num
					return 0
			return 0
```

##### Approach-2 ( Recursion ).
##### Solution Explanation
```
Need to check up to floor(sqrt(num)) = s (inclusive) only because 
for any divisor d < s, there is another divisor num/d > s.

E.g. 81 has divisors 1, 3, 9, 27, 81. sqrt(81) = 9 has divisors 1, 3, 9.
81/1 = 81, 81/3 = 27, 81/9 = 9. So if we only check for divisors up to 9 
and account for 81/divisor, we reduce time complexity by sqrt(num).
```

#### [LC-1:Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
##### Solution Explanation
```
Approach: One-pass Hash Table

While we iterate and insert elements into the table : 
 - we also look back to check if current element's complement already exists in the table. 
 - If it exists, we have found a solution and return immediately.
```
##### Complexity Analysis:
```
Time  : O(N)
========================
We traverse the list containing N elements only once. Each look up in the table costs only O(1) time.

Space : O(N)
========================
The extra space required depends on the number of items stored in the hash table, which stores at most N elements.
```
```python
def twoSum(nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
    dic = {}
    for i,num in enumerate(nums):
        if target-num in dic:
            return [dic[target-num], i]
        dic[num]=i

if __name__ == "__main__":
    #Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
    #Output: [0,1]
    #Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
    nums = [2,7,11,15]
    target = 9
    print(twoSum(nums))
```
```kotlin
fun twoSum(nums: IntArray, target: Int): IntArray {
    val complements = HashMap<Int, Int>()
    nums.forEachIndexed { index, num ->
        with(target - num) { with(complements[this]) { this?.let { return intArrayOf(this, index) } } }
        complements[num] = index
    }
    throw IllegalArgumentException("No two sum solution")
}

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    //Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
    //Output: [0,1]
    //Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
    val nums = intArrayOf(2, 7, 11, 15)
    val target = 9
    //contentToString() deprecated from kotlin version 1.4 onwards
    //println(twoSum(nums, target).contentToString())
    println(twoSum(nums, target).joinToString(","))

#### [LC-121:Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)
##### Solution Explanation
```
Approach: Dynamic Programming + State Machine
=================================================================================================================================================================

- It is impossible to have stock to sell on first day, so -infinity is set as initial value for cur_hold and cur_not_hold is set to 0
- Iterate through the list of prices
  + Either keep in hold, or just buy today with stock price
  + Either keep in not holding, or just sell today with stock price
- Max profit must be in not-hold state

                                  Sell
                                  + stock price to balance
                      +------------------------------------------------+
                     /                                                  \

 |      + Not Hold  +                                                   +    Hold   +      | Keep in hold

 Keep in not holding \                                                  /

```
##### Complexity Analysis:
```

No need for a dp array. We have replaced dp array with a variable called cur_not_hold.

#### [LC-217:Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/)
##### Solution Explanation ( 2 possible solutions w/ their trade-offs explained ):
```
- For a sufficiently large value of N, choose Approach 2 ( Hash Table based approach ).
- When N is not sufficiently large, choose Approach 1 ( Sorting based approach ).

Two Possible Solutions (with their trade-offs explained)
=================================================================================================================================================================
Approach 1: Sorting
=================================================================================================================================================================
Intuition
-------------------------
If there are any duplicate integers, they will be consecutive after sorting.

Algorithm
-------------------------
- This approach employs sorting algorithm.
- Since comparison sorting algorithm like heapsort is known to provide O(N*log(N)) worst-case performance, sorting is often a good preprocessing step. 
- After sorting, we can sweep the sorted array to find if there are any two consecutive duplicate elements.

=================================================================================================================================================================
Complexity Analysis:
=================================================================================================================================================================

Time complexity : O(N*log(N))
========================
Sorting is O(N*log(N)) and the sweeping is O(N).
The entire algorithm is dominated by the sorting step, which is O(N*log(N)).

Space complexity : O(1)
========================
Space depends on the sorting implementation which, usually,
costs O(1) auxiliary space if heapsort is used.

Note
-------------------------
+ The implementation here modifies the original array by sorting it. 
+ In general, it is not a good practice to modify the input unless it is clear to the caller that the input will be modified. 
+ One may make a copy of nums and operate on the copy instead.

=================================================================================================================================================================
Approach 2: Hash Table
=================================================================================================================================================================
Intuition
-------------------------
Utilize a dynamic data structure that supports fast search and insert operations.

Algorithm
-------------------------
From Approach #1 we know that search operations is O(N) in an unsorted array and we did so repeatedly.
Utilizing a data structure with faster search time will speed up the entire algorithm.

There are many data structures commonly used as dynamic sets such as Binary Search Tree and Hash Table.
The operations we need to support here are search() and insert().
For a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (TreeSet or TreeMap in Java), search() and insert() are both O(log(N)) time.
For a Hash Table (HashSet or HashMap in Java), search() and insert() are both O(1) on average.
Therefore, by using hash table, we can achieve linear time complexity for finding the duplicate in an unsorted array.

=================================================================================================================================================================
Complexity Analysis:
=================================================================================================================================================================

Time complexity : O(N)
========================
We do search() and insert() for N times and each operation takes constant time.

Space complexity : O(N)
========================
The space used by a hash table is linear with the number of elements in it.

Note
-------------------------
+ For certain test cases with not very large N, the runtime of this method can be slower than Approach #2.
+ The reason is hash table has some overhead in maintaining its property.
+ One should keep in mind that real world performance can be different from what the Big-O notation says.
+ The Big-O notation only tells us that for sufficiently large input, one will be faster than the other.
+ Therefore, when N is not sufficiently large, an O(N) algorithm can be slower than an O(N*log(N)) algorithm.

#### [LC-238:Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/)
##### Solution Explanation
```
=================================================================================================================================================================
Approach 1: Left and Right Arrays that capture the multiplication product scanning from left-to-right or right-to-left.
=================================================================================================================================================================
- We maintain a left and right array that captures the multiplication product scanning from left-to-right or right-to-left.
- The time complexity is two linear traversals, thus it's linear time.

- The tricky part is to keep a multiplicative counter with result till its previous element (not its self),
  and assign this value on to its left/right_array.

=================================================================================================================================================================
Approach 2: Optimized Space Solution. Without using extra memory of left and right product list.
=================================================================================================================================================================
Step 1. Create a list that contains the product of all left side elements except the current index of nums element.
Step 2. Create a variable of the right product and multiply with what we have in Step 1 (List that contains all the
        left side produts except the current index itself) through the loop --> this will calculate the product of
        array except for self.
Step 3. Keep updating the right product and loop.
Step 4. Return the answer.
```
##### Complexity Analysis:
```
=================================================================================================================================================================
Approach 1: Left and Right Arrays that capture the multiplication product scanning from left-to-right or right-to-left.
=================================================================================================================================================================
Time complexity : O(N) [ Technically O(2N) ]
========================
We traverse the list containing N elements twice. Each look up in the list costs only O(1) time.

Space complexity : O(1) [ As per problem, the output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis. ]
========================
Constant space since we only create a single output array to store the results.

#### [LC-53:Maximum Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)
##### Solution Explanation ( 2 possible solutions w/ their trade-offs explained ):
```
Approach 1: Kadane's Algorithm
-------------------------------
The largest subarray is either:
  - the current element
  - sum of previous elements

If the current element does not increase the value a local maximum subarray is found.

If local > global replace otherwise keep going

Problem is called Kadane's algorithm.

           https://medium.com/@rsinghal757/kadanes-algorithm-dynamic-programming-how-and-why-does-it-work-3fd8849ed73d


=================================================================================================================================================================
Complexity Analysis:
=================================================================================================================================================================

Time complexity : O(N)
========================
The time complexity of Kadane’s algorithm is O(N) because there is only one for loop which scans the entire array exactly once.

Space complexity : O(1)
========================
Kadane’s algorithm uses a constant space. So, the space complexity is O(1).


Approach 2: Divide and Conquer
-------------------------------
Explanation :

In the approach, we follow a divide and conquer approach similar to merge sort.

We use a helper functionhelper for this, wherein we pass in a starting index and the ending index to look at. The idea is to use this helper function recurseively.

Within the helper function, for a given start and end index, we find the mid of the array and split the array into two parts. Part 1 being the start ... mid and part 2 being mid+1 ... end. For each of the parts, we return 4 pieces of information.

1. The best possible answer within the subArray ==> ans
2. The maxSubarraySum starting at the beginning of the subArray ==> maxFromBegging
3. The maxSubarraySum ending at the end of the subArray ==> maxFromEnd
4. The total sum of the subArray ==> totalSum

With these four pieces of information for the two split parts, it is possible to combine them to generate a similar four pieces of information for the aggregated array. The trick to get an O(n) solution is to combine the information in a constant time.

The details of combing the information to curry up the information is as follows. (For each of 1-4 above, I will be prefexing left_ or right_ to denote they came from left/right subArray)

1. For part (1), we need to take the maximum of left_ans (best answer in left subarray), right_ans (nest answer in right subarray) and the crossover. The crossover is simply left_maxFromEnd + right_maxFromBeginning. The max these 3 components gives us the ans. For the highest level recursion, this is all we need.

2. For maxFromBeginning, we take the maximum among left_maxFromBeginning and left_totalSum + right_maxFromBeginning. This logically makes sense i.e either we want to take the result of left part or take the entire left part and merge it with the result from the right part.

3. For maxFromEnd, it is similar to above and we take the maximum among right_maxFromEnd and right_totalSum + left_maxFromEnd

4. For totalSum, we add the left_totalSum and right_totalSum.

Time Complexity : T(n) = 2*T(n/2) + 1 ==> O(n)

Time complexity : O(N)
========================
Time Complexity : T(n) = 2*T(n/2) + 1 ==> O(N) .. See this for proof https://youtu.be/OynWkEj0S-s?t=273.

Space complexity : O(log(N))
========================
Space Complexity : O(log(N)) since we are recursing and the call stack/number of recursive calls is of the order of log(N).

##### Approach-1 ( Kadane's Algorithm ):
```python
# If we are only interested in returning the sum of max sub-array
def maxSubArray(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    # largest subarray found in entire problem
    maxGlobal = nums[0]
    # current maximum subarray that is reset
    maxCurrent = nums[0]
        
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        maxCurrent  = max(nums[i], maxCurrent + nums[i])
        maxGlobal = max(maxCurrent, maxGlobal)
        
    return maxGlobal

if __name__ == "__main__":
    #Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
    #Output: 6
    #Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
    nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
    print(maxSubArray(nums))


# Variant: If we are interested in returning the actual max sub-array

# We can easily solve this problem in linear time using Kadane's algorithm.
# The idea is to maintain a maximum (positive-sum) subarray "ending" at each index of the given array.
# 	- The subarray is either empty (in which case its sum is zero) or 
#	- The subarray consists of one more element than the maximum subarray ending at the previous index.
 
#Variant (Also print the list)
# - Modify Kadane's algorithm which outputs only the sum of contiguous subarray with the largest sum but
#   does not print the subarray itself.
# - Keep track of the maximum subarray's starting and ending indices.

# Function to print contiguous sublist with the largest sum
# in a given set of integers
def maxSubArray(A: List[int]) -> List[int]:
 
    # stores maximum sum sublist found so far
    maxSoFar = 0
 
    # stores the maximum sum of sublist ending at the current position
    maxEndingHere = 0
 
    # stores endpoints of maximum sum sublist found so far
    start = end = 0
 
    # stores starting index of a positive-sum sequence
    beg = 0
 
    # traverse the given list
    for i in range(len(A)):
 
        # update the maximum sum of sublist "ending" at index `i`
        maxEndingHere = maxEndingHere + A[i]
 
        # if the maximum sum is negative, set it to 0
        if maxEndingHere < 0:
            maxEndingHere = 0        # empty sublist
            beg = i + 1
 
        # update result if the current sublist sum is found to be greater
        if maxSoFar < maxEndingHere:
            maxSoFar = maxEndingHere
            start = beg
            end = i
 
    #print(f"The sum of contiguous sublist with the largest sum is: {maxSoFar}")
    #print(f"The contiguous sublist with the largest sum is: {A[start: end + 1]}")
    return A[start: end + 1]

#### [LC-152:Maximum Product Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-subarray/)
##### Solution Explanation
```
Kadane's Algorithm
=================================================================================================================================================================
In this solution we keep track of both the minimum and the maximum subarray encountered so far. 
This is done in a Kadane like fashion, where the updates for both the current minimal streak and maximal streak depend on the other, 
while the maximum encountered so far only depends on the current maximum, and the updated current maximal streak.
```
##### Complexity Analysis:
```
Time  : O(N)
========================
The time complexity of Kadane’s algorithm is O(N) because there is only one for loop which scans the entire array exactly once.

Space : O(1)

Kadane’s algorithm uses a constant space. So, the space complexity is O(1).

#### [LC-153:Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/)
##### Solution Explanation:
```
Binary Search Algorithm
=================================================================================================================================================================

Algorithm

1. Find the mid element of the array.

2. If mid element > first element of array this means that we need to look for the inflection point on the right of mid.

3. If mid element < first element of array this that we need to look for the inflection point on the left of mid.

          6 > 4
     +-------------+
     |             |
    \|/            |
 +---*--+------+---*--+------+------+------+
 |   4  |   5  |   6  |   7  |   2  |   3  |
 +------+------+------+------+------+------+
   Left           Mid                 Right
                     ---------------------->

In the above example mid element 6 is greater than first element 4. Hence we continue our search for the inflection point to the right of mid.

4 . We stop our search when we find the inflection point, when either of the two conditions is satisfied:

nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1] Hence, mid+1 is the smallest.

nums[mid - 1] > nums[mid] Hence, mid is the smallest.

                          +------+
                          |      |
                         \|/     |
 +------+------+------+---*--+---*--+------+
 |   4  |   5  |   6  |   7  |   2  |   3  |
 +------+------+------+------+------+------+
                        Left    Mid   Right

In the above example. With the marked left and right pointers. 
The mid element is 2. The element just before 2 is 7 and 7>2 i.e. nums[mid - 1] > nums[mid]. 
Thus we have found the point of inflection and 2 is the smallest element.

Detailed Algorithm
-----------------------

1) set left and right bounds
2) left and right both converge to the minimum index; DO NOT use left <= right because that would loop forever
  2.1) find the middle value between the left and right bounds (their average);
       can equivalently do: mid = left + (right - left) // 2,
       if we are concerned left + right would cause overflow (which would occur
       if we are searching a massive array using a language like Java or C that has
       fixed size integer types)
  2.2) the main idea for our checks is to converge the left and right bounds on the start
       of the pivot, and never disqualify the index for a possible minimum value.
  2.3) in normal binary search, we have a target to match exactly,
       and would have a specific branch for if nums[mid] == target.
       we do not have a specific target here, so we just have simple if/else.
  2.4) if nums[mid] > nums[right]
    2.4.1) we KNOW the pivot must be to the right of the middle:
           if nums[mid] > nums[right], we KNOW that the
           pivot/minimum value must have occurred somewhere to the right
           of mid, which is why the values wrapped around and became smaller.
    2.4.2) example:  [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2]
           in the first iteration, when we start with mid index = 4, right index = 9.
           if nums[mid] > nums[right], we know that at some point to the right of mid,
           the pivot must have occurred, which is why the values wrapped around
           so that nums[right] is less then nums[mid]
    2.4.3) we know that the number at mid is greater than at least
           one number to the right, so we can use mid + 1 and
           never consider mid again; we know there is at least
           one value smaller than it on the right
  2.5) if nums[mid] <= nums[right]
    2.5.1) here, nums[mid] <= nums[right]:
           we KNOW the pivot must be at mid or to the left of mid:
           if nums[mid] <= nums[right], we KNOW that the pivot was not encountered
           to the right of middle, because that means the values would wrap around
           and become smaller (which is caught in the above if statement).
           this leaves the possible pivot point to be at index <= mid.

    2.5.2) example: [8,9,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
           in the first iteration, when we start with mid index = 4, right index = 9.
           if nums[mid] <= nums[right], we know the numbers continued increasing to
           the right of mid, so they never reached the pivot and wrapped around.
           therefore, we know the pivot must be at index <= mid.

    2.5.3) we know that nums[mid] <= nums[right].
           therefore, we know it is possible for the mid index to store a smaller
           value than at least one other index in the list (at right), so we do
           not discard it by doing right = mid - 1. it still might have the minimum value.

3) at this point, left and right converge to a single index (for minimum value) since
   our if/else forces the bounds of left/right to shrink each iteration:

4) when left bound increases, it does not disqualify a value
   that could be smaller than something else (we know nums[mid] > nums[right],
   so nums[right] wins and we ignore mid and everything to the left of mid).

5) when right bound decreases, it also does not disqualify a
   value that could be smaller than something else (we know nums[mid] <= nums[right],
   so nums[mid] wins and we keep it for now).

6) so we shrink the left/right bounds to one value,
   without ever disqualifying a possible minimum.

#### [LC-33:Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)
##### Solution Explanation:
```
Binary Search Algorithm
=================================================================================================================================================================
Idea:
--------------------------
We have an ascending array, which is rotated at some pivot.
Let's call the rotation the inflection point. (IP)
One characteristic the inflection point holds is: arr[IP] > arr[IP + 1] and arr[IP] > arr[IP - 1]
So if we had an array like: [7, 8, 9, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4] the inflection point, IP would be the number 9.

One thing we can see is that values until the IP are ascending. And values from IP + 1 until end are also ascending (binary search, wink, wink).
Also the values from [0, IP] are always bigger than [IP + 1, n].

Intuition:
--------------------------
We can perform a Binary Search.
If A[mid] is bigger than A[left] we know the inflection point will be to the right of us, meaning values from a[left]...a[mid] are ascending.

So if target is between that range we just cut our search space to the left.
Otherwise go right.

The other condition is that A[mid] is not bigger than A[left] meaning a[mid]...a[right] is ascending.
In the same manner we can check if target is in that range and cut the search space correspondingly.
```
##### Complexity Analysis:
```
Time Complexity : O(log(N))

Space Complexity : O(1)

    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if nums[mid] == target: return mid
            
        # inflection point to the right. Left is strictly increasing
        if nums[mid] >= nums[left]:
            if nums[left] <= target < nums[mid]:
                right = mid - 1

                left = mid + 1

#### [LC-15:3Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)
##### Solution Explanation:
```
Two Pointers
=================================================================================================================================================================
1) Let n be the size of the list.
2) First sort the list.
3) Iterate through the list from index => i = 0 to i < n-2.
   3.1) Since the list is sorted, if nums[i] > 0, then all 
        nums[j] with j > i are positive as well, and we cannot
        have three positive numbers sum up to 0. Return immediately.
   3.2) The nums[i] == nums[i-1] condition helps us avoid duplicates.
        E.g., given [-1, -1, 0, 0, 1], when i = 0, we see [-1, 0, 1]
        works. Now at i = 1, since nums[1] == -1 == nums[0], we avoid
        this iteration and thus avoid duplicates. The i > 0 condition
        is to avoid negative index, i.e., when i = 0, nums[i-1] = nums[-1]
        and you don't want to skip this iteration when nums[0] == nums[-1]
   3.3) Set left pointer to i+1 and right pointer to n-1
   3.4) While left pointer is less than right pointer ( Now we have a Classic two pointer solution )
        3.4.1) calculate sum => sum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]
        3.4.2) sum too small ( sum < 0 ), move left ptr
        3.4.3) sum too large ( sum > 0 ), move right ptr
        3.4.4) sum == 0
               3.4.4.1) we need to skip elements that are identical to our
                        current solution, otherwise we would have duplicated triples
```
##### Complexity Analysis:
```
Time  : O(N^2) [ Quadratic ]
========================
2SUM time complexity is O(N).
Every higher SUM (k-sum) will have complexity => O(N^k-1) ... So for 3SUM with k=3 we get O(N^(3-1)) = O(N^2).

reason for k-1: last 2 depths are solved by 2 sum sorted

Details
-------
python built-in sort method is using timSort. Therefore bestcase time complexity is O(N), otherwise O(NlogN).
The rest of the algorithm takes O(N^2).

Space : O(N)
========================
If we do not consider the result list, the space complexity is bounded by O(N).

If we consider the result list, then space complexity becomes => O(N^2).

#### [LC-11:Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)
##### Formal Proof than an O(N) solution exists:
```
Formal Proof than an O(N) solution exists:
=================================================================================================================================================================
Problem Description:
Condition: We have two pointers at i & j, suppose h[i] <= h[j].
Goal to Prove: If there is a better answer within the sub-range of [i, j], then the range [i + 1, j] must contain that optimal sub-range. (This doesn't mean range [i, j - 1] can't contain it, we just want to prove range [i + 1, j] will contain it).

Proof:
Since we assume there is a better answer in the sub-range of [i, j], then this optimal range must be contained by either [i + 1, j] or [i, j - 1], or both.

Let's assume [i + 1, j] doesn't contain the optimal range, but [i, j - 1] contains it. Then this means two things:

the optimal range is not in [i + 1, j - 1], otherwise, [i + 1, j] will contain it.
The optimal range contains the block [i, i + 1] (since this is the part which exists in [i, j - 1] but not in [i+1, j]).
However, notice that, len(i, j - 1) < len(i, j), and in the range [i, j], the area is constrained by the height of h[i] (even in the case h[i] == h[j]). Thus, in the range [i, j - 1], even all pillar are no shorter than h[j], the maximum area is smaller than the area formed by i & j, which contradicts our assumption there is a better answer in the sub-range of [i, j]. This contradiction suggests [i + 1, j] contains the optimal sub-range, if such sub-range exists.

According to above theorem, we can design the algorithm, whenever h[i] < h[j], we advance the pointer i.
```
##### Solution Explanation:
```
=================================================================================================================================================================
Solution Explanation:
Two Pointers
=================================================================================================================================================================
- O(N) solution which is explained in editorial. Why the solution works needs some thought.
- Use two pointers start and end initialized at 0 and N-1
- Now compute the area implied by these pointers as (end-start) * min (height[start], height[end])
- if height[start] < height[end], start = start + 1 else end = end -1
- Why? Imagine height[start] < height[end]. Then is there any need to compare height[end-1] with height[start]? 
  There is no way we can now get a larger area using height[start] as one of the end points. We should therefore move start.

#### [LC-371:Sum of Two Integers](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-two-integers/)
##### Solution Explanation:
```
=====================================
Java/Kotlin
=====================================
For this problem, the main crux is that, we are dividing the task of adding 2 numbers into two parts -

Let a = 13 and b = 10. Then we want to add them, a+b
In binary, it would look as follows -
a      =  1 1 0 1
b      =  1 0 1 0
--------------------
a+b = (1) 0 1 1 1
Now we can break the addition into two parts, one is simple addition without taking care of carry, and other is taking the carry.
With that strategy in mind, we have the following -
simpleAddition(a, b):
a      =  1 1 0 1
b      =  1 0 1 0
--------------------
a+b    =  0 1 1 1  

carry(a, b):
carry = 1 0 0 0 0
*shift left by one, because we add the carry next left step :P
Now if we can add the carry to our simpleAddition result, we can get our final answer. So add them using the simpleAddition method, and take care of the new carry again, unless carry becomes zero.
This simpleAddition is performed by XOR ^operator, and the carry is performed by AND &operator.
So our final answer would look as -
(a^b) =    0 1 1 1 
+carry = 1 0 0 0 0 
-----------------------------
ans =    1 0 1 1 1
-----------------------------
which is 23

References:
===============================================================
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adder_%28electronics%29#Half_adder

The half adder adds two single binary digits A and B. It has two outputs, sum (S) and carry (C).
The carry signal represents an overflow into the next digit of a multi-digit addition. 
The value of the sum is 2C + S. 

=====================================
Python
=====================================
Python doesn't respect this int boundary that other strongly typed languages like Java and C++ have defined.
So we need to use a mask.

=====================================
Let's recall the rule for taking two's complements: Flip all the bits, then plus one.

So, to take the two's complement of -20 in the 32 bits sense. We flip all the 32 bits of 0xFFFFFFEC and add 1 to it.
Note that here we cannot use the bit operation ~ because it will flip infinite many bits, not only the last 32.
Instead, we xor it with the mask 0xFFFFFFFF. Recall that xor with 1 has the same effect as flipping.
This only flips the last 32 bits, all the 0's to the far left remains intact.
Then we add 1 to it to finish the two's complement and produce a valid 20

(0xFFFFFFEC^mask)+1 == 0x14 == 20
Next, we take the two's complement of 20 in the Python fashion. Now we can direcly use the default bit operation

~20+1 == -20
Write these two steps in one line

~((0xFFFFFFEC^mask)+1)+1 == -20 == 0x...FFFFFFFFFFFFFFEC
Wait a minute, do you spot anything weird? We are not supposed to use + in the first place, right? Why are there two +1's?
Does it mean this method won't work? Hold up and let me give the final magic of today:

for any number x, we have

~(x+1)+1 = ~x
(Here the whole (0xFFFFFFEC^mask) is considered as x).

In other words, the two +1's miracly cancel each other! so we can simly write

~(0xFFFFFFEC^mask) == -20
To sum up, since Python allows arbitary length for integers, we first use a mask 0xFFFFFFFF to restrict the lengths.
But then we lose information for negative numbers, so we use the magical formula ~(a^mask) to convert the result to Python-interpretable form.

#### [LC-191:Number of 1 Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/)
##### Solution Explanation:
```
=================================================================================================================================================================
Approach-1 ( Using masking )
=================================================================================================================================================================
Solution Explanation:
Using masking
=================================================================================================================================================================
The best solution for this problem is to use "divide and conquer" to count bits:

- First, count adjacent two bits, the results are stored separatedly into two bit spaces;
- Second is to count the results from each of the previous two bits and store results to four bit spaces;
- Repeat those steps and the final result will be sumed.
- Check the following diagram from Hack's Delight book to understand the procedure:


x = (x & 0x55555555) + ((x >> 1) & 0x55555555);
x = (x & 0x33333333) + ((x >> 2) & 0x33333333);
x = (x & 0x0F0F0F0F) + ((x >> 4) & 0x0F0F0F0F);
x = (x & 0x00FF00FF) + ((x >> 8) & 0x00FF00FF);
x = (x & 0x0000FFFF) + ((x >> 16) & 0x0000FFFF);

The first line uses (x >> 1) & 0x55555555 rather than the perhaps more natural (x & 0xAAAAAAAA) >> 1,
because the code shown avoids generating two large constants in a register. This would cost an
instruction if the machine lacks the and not instruction. A similar remark applies to the other lines.
Clearly, the last and is unnecessary, and other and’s can be omitted when there is no danger that a
field’s sum will carry over into the adjacent field. Furthermore, there is a way to code the first line
that uses one fewer instruction. This leads to the simplification shown in Figure 5–2, which executes
in 21 instructions and is branch-free.

Approach-2 ( Using Brian Kernighan Algorithm )
=================================================================================================================================================================
Solution Explanation:
Kernighan way
=================================================================================================================================================================
If we can somehow get rid of iterating through all the 32 bits and only iterate as many times as there are 1's, wouldn't that be better?
Below is a solution that does this. It's based on Kernighan's number of set bits counting algorithm.
=================================================================================================================================================================
To solve this problem efficiently one must be familiar with Brian Kernighans Bit Manipulation Algorithm 
which is used to count the number of set bits in a binary representation of a number k. (a bit is considered set if it has the value of 1)

Resource: https://www.techiedelight.com/brian-kernighans-algorithm-count-set-bits-integer/
=================================================================================================================================================================

Using Brian Kernighan Algorithm, we will not check/compare or loop through all the 32 bits present
but only count the set bits which is way better than checking all the 32 bits

Suppose we have a number 00000000000000000000000000010110 (32 bits).

Now using this algorithm we will skip the 0's bit and directly jump to set bit(1's bit) 
and we don't have to go through each bit to count set bits i.e. the loop will be executed 
only for 3 times in the mentioned example and not for 32 times.


Assume we are working for 8 bits for better understanding, but the same logic apply for 32 bits
So, we will take a number having 3 set bits.
n = 00010110
n - 1 = 00010101 (by substracting 1 from the number, all the bits gets flipped/toggled after the MSB(most significant right bit) including the MSB itself
After applying &(bitwise AND) operator on n and n - 1 i.e. (n & n - 1), the righmost set bit will be turned off/toggled/flipped

Let's understand step by step:
===============================
* 1st Iteration
     00010110 --> (22(n) in decimal)
  &  00010101 --> (21(n - 1) in decimal i.e. flipping all the bits of n(22) after MSB including the MSB)
  -----------
     00010100 --> (20(n & n - 1) in decimal i.e after applying bitwise AND(&), the MSB will be turned off)

After applying bitwise AND(&) ,assign this number to n i.e. n = n & n - 1
n = 00010100(20 in decimal)
and increase the count
bitCount++ (Initial bitCount = 0. By incrementing it, the bitCount = 1)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* 2nd Iteration
     00010100 --> (20(n) in decimal)
  &  00010011 --> (19(n - 1) in decimal i.e. flipping all the bits of n(20) after MSB including the MSB)
  -----------
     00010000 --> (16(n & n - 1) in decimal i.e after applying bitwise AND(&), the MSB will be turned off)

After applying bitwise AND(&) ,assign this number to n i.e. n = n & n - 1
n = 00010000(16 in decimal)
and increase the count
bitCount++ (previous bitCount = 1. By incrementing it, the bitCount = 2)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* 3rd Iteration
     00010000 --> (16(n) in decimal)
  &  00001111 --> (15(n - 1) in decimal i.e. flipping all the bits of n(16) after MSB including the MSB)
  -----------
     00000000 --> (0(n & n - 1) in decimal i.e after applying bitwise AND(&), the MSB will be turned off)

After applying bitwise AND(&) ,assign this number to n i.e. n = n & n - 1
n = 00000000 (0 in decimal)
and increase the count
bitCount++ (previous bitCount = 2. By incrementing it, the bitCount = 3)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, since the n = 0, there will be no furthur iteration as the condition becomes false, so it will come 
out of the loop and return bitCount which is 3 which is desired output.

which is used to count the number of set bits in a binary representation of a number k. (a bit is considered set if it has the value of 1)

Resource: https://www.techiedelight.com/brian-kernighans-algorithm-count-set-bits-integer/
```
##### Solution Explanation:
```
Intuition:
=================================================================================================================================================================

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming combined with a bit manipulation technique.

Overview
------------------
Recall the goal is to count the number of set bits in the binary representation of all integers 0 to n and record the set bits count of each number.
This can be done in O(N) time and using O(N) space.

To solve this problem efficiently one must be familiar with Brian Kernighans Bit Manipulation Algorithm which is used to count the number 
of set bits in a binary representation of a number k. (a bit is considered set if it has the value of 1)

Intially it seems just to be aware of Kernighans algorithm is enough to solve this problem, but this is not the case. 
It would be naive to calculate the set bit count of each number from 1 to n and record the result for each number.
This is because Kernighans Algorithm has a runtime of of O(S) where S is the number of set bits in a number. 
This is because in each iteration a set bits in the original number is changed from 1 to 0 until there are no more set bits. 
This must be done for all N numbers.
The runtime of this approach is O(N*S) time. We can do better.


Optimization
We can use dynamic programming to eliminate uncessary work.

The uncessary work is calculating the set bit count for each number from 0 to n.

if we use a cache and leverage the heart of kernighans algorithm, we can avoid explictly calculating the set bit count for each number reducing the runtime to O(N)

The heart of kernighans algorithm uses a bit manipulation techinuque to turn off (set 1 to 0) the least significant bit (rightmost) in a number. an AND operation is perfomerd be between the binary representations of k and k-1. this results in a number m who's set bits count is one less than k. The algorithm performs this operation on each iteration, eahc time updating k to the value of m. in python this operation is k = k & (k - 1)

The key observation for optimization is that, if we count the set bits of each number in sorted order and we cache the results. for any given number k which no set bit count has been recorded, we can always lookup a number m who has a set bits count that is one less than k. if we know the set bit count of m, we can get the set bits count of k by adding one to the set bits count of m. lookup is possible because we are going in sorted order and it is the case m <= k.

if we use kernighans bit manipulation technique, m can always be found in constant time.
if we start at 0 we can build our way up to n. obtaining all counts along the way.

if n = 4
0 -> 0 set bits by default
thus dp[0] = 0

Now how do we count the set bits of the number 1?
Using kernighans technique we can find a number that has one less set bit than the binary representation of 1. that number is zero.

1 -> 1 & (1 - 1) = 0

You can think of 1 ask and 0 asm from above explanation

Thus if we add 1 + 0 we get the set bit count for the binary representation of one.
count set bits in binary representation of 1 dp[1] = 1 + dp[0] = 1 + 0 = 1

count set bits in binary representation of  2 
dp = [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
2 -> 2 & (2 - 1) = 0
base 2: 0010  & 0001 = 0000
dp[2] = 1 + dp[0] =  0 + 1 = 1 

count set bits in binary representation of  3 
dp = [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
3 -> 3 & (3 - 1) = 3 & 2 = 2
base 2: 0011  & 0010 = 0010 
dp[3] = 1 + dp[2] =  1 + 1 = 2

count set bits in binary representation of  4 
dp = [0, 1, 1, 2, 0]
4 -> 4 & (4 - 1) = 4 & 3 = 2
base 2: 0100  & 0011 = 0100
dp[4] = 1 + dp[4] =  1 + 0 = 1

result 
dp = [0, 1, 1, 2, 1]

the pattern from these examples is 
dp[i]  = 1 + dp[i & (i - 1)]

##### Solution Explanation:
```
Bitwise XOR Operation
=================================================================================================================================================================

- The basic idea is to use XOR operation.
- We all know that a^b^b =a, which means two xor operations with the same number will eliminate the number and reveal the original number.
- In this solution, I apply XOR operation to both the index and value of the array. 
- In a complete array with no missing numbers, the index and value should be perfectly corresponding( nums[index] = index), 
  so in a missing array, what left finally is the missing number.

#### [LC-190:Reverse Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits/)
##### Solution Explanation:
```
Bitwise XOR Operation
=================================================================================================================================================================
Approach 1: Bit Manipulation and Bit-wise XOR operation
=================================================================================================================================================================

- In each loop, use logical AND operation n & 1 to get the least significant bit and add it to the ans. 
- To reverse the bit, shift n and ans in opposite directions.
- What needs attention is that, after we add the last bit of n to ans at the 32nd loop,
  the following left shift of ans is no longer needed.
- The most significant bit of n has already at the right most position after previous 31 loops.
=================================================================================================================================================================

=================================================================================================================================================================
Approach 2: Using Masking
=================================================================================================================================================================
For 8 bit binary number A B C D E F G H, the process is like: A B C D E F G H --> E F G H A B C D --> G H E F C D A B --> H G F E D C B A

#### [LC-70:Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)
##### Solution Explanation:
```
Intuition
---------
Solution to this problem makes a Fibonacci sequence. We can understand it better if we start from the end. 
To reach to Step N, you can either reach to step N-1 and take 1 step from there or take 2 step from N - 2.
Therefore it can be summarized as:
F(N) = F(N-1) + F(N-2)

Once you have recognized the pattern, it is very easy to write the code:
---------

Solution Approach:
DP and Fibonacci Sequence
=================================================================================================================================================================
To reach a specific stair x, we can either climb 1 stair from x-1, or 2 stairs from x-2. 
Therefore, suppose dp[i] records the number of ways to reach stair i, dp[i] = dp[i-1]+dp[i-2]. 
And it's a Fibonacci Array.
The base case is to reach the first stair, we only have one way to do it so dp[1] = 1.

Besides, since only dp elements we used is most recent two elements, we can use two pointers to save using of dp array. 
So space complexity is O(1).

Solution Approach:
DP
=================================================================================================================================================================

Assume dp[i] is the fewest number of coins making up amount i, then for every coin in coins, dp[i] = min(dp[i - coin] + 1).

The time complexity is O(amount * coins.length) and the space complexity is O(amount).

#### [LC-300:Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/)
##### Solution Explanation:
```
=================================================================================================================================================================
Approach 1: Patience Sorting using Binary Search
=================================================================================================================================================================
This algorithm is actually Patience sorting. 
It might be easier for you to understand how it works if you think about it as piles of cards instead of tails.
The number of piles is the length of the longest subsequence.
For more info see Princeton lecture.

1) Initially, there are no piles. The first card dealt forms a new pile consisting of the single card.
2) Each subsequent card is placed on the leftmost existing pile whose top card has a value greater 
   than or equal to the new card's value, or to the right of all of the existing piles, thus forming a new pile.
3) When there are no more cards remaining to deal, the game ends.

Detailed Algorithm:
-----------------------
piles is an array storing the smallest tail of all increasing subsequences with length i+1 in piles[i].
For example, say we have nums = [4,5,6,3], then all the available increasing subsequences are:

len = 1   :      [4], [5], [6], [3]   => piles[0] = 3
len = 2   :      [4, 5], [5, 6]       => piles[1] = 5
len = 3   :      [4, 5, 6]            => piles[2] = 6
We can easily prove that piles is a increasing array. Therefore it is possible to do a binary search in piles array to find the one needs update.

Each time we only do one of the two:

(1) if num is larger than all piles, append it, increase the size by 1
(2) if piles[i-1] < num <= piles[i], update piles[i]
(3) Doing so will maintain the piles invariant. The the final answer is just the size.

=================================================================================================================================================================
Approach 2: DP
=================================================================================================================================================================
1) Check the base case, if nums has size less than or equal to 1, then return length of nums
2) Create a 'dp' array of size nums.length to track the longest sequence length
3) Fill each position with value 1 in the array
4) Mark one pointer at i. For each i, start from j=0.
   4.1.1) If, nums[j] < nums[i], it means next number contributes to increasing sequence. 
      4.1.1.1) But increase the value only if it results in a larger value of the sequence than dp[i].
               It is possible that dp[i] already has larger value from some previous j'th iteration.
5) Find the maximum length from the array that we just generated.

#### [LC-377:Combination Sum IV](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-iv/)
##### Solution Explanation:
```
Solution Approach:
DP
=================================================================================================================================================================

Idea:
With this problem, we can easily imagine breaking up the solution into smaller pieces that we can use as stepping stones 
towards the overall answer. For example, if we're searching for a way to get from 0 to our target number (T), 
and if 0 < x < y < T, then we can see that finding out how many ways we can get 
from y to T will help us figure out how many ways we can get from x to T, 
all the way down to 0 to T. 

This is a classic example of a top-down (memoization) dyanamic programming (DP) solution.

Of course, the reverse is also true, and we could instead choose to use a bottom-up (tabulation) DP solution with the same result.

Top-Down DP Approach: 
---------------------

Our DP array (dp) will contain cells (dp[i]) where i will represent the remaining space left before T 
and dp[i] will represent the number of ways the solution (dp[T]) can be reached from i.
At each value of i as we build out dp we'll iterate through the different nums in our number array (N) 
and consider the cell that can be reached with each num (dp[i-num]). 
The value of dp[i] will therefore be the sum of the results of each of those possible moves.

We'll need to seed dp[0] with a value of 1 to represent the value of the completed combination, 
then once the iteration is complete, we can return dp[T] as our final answer.

Bottom-Up DP Approach: 
---------------------

Our DP array (dp) will contain cells (dp[i]) where i will represent the current count as we head towards T 
and dp[i] will represent the number of ways we can reach i from the starting point (dp[0]).
This means that dp[T] will represent our final solution.

At each value of i as we build out dp we'll iterate through the different nums in our number array (N)
and update the value of the cell that can be reached with each num (dp[i+num]) by adding the result 
of the current cell (dp[i]). If the current cell has no value, then we can continue without 
needing to iterate through N.

We'll need to seed dp[0] with a value of 1 to represent the value of the common starting point, 
then once the iteration is complete, we can return dp[T] as our final answer.
```
##### Complexity Analysis:

In both the top-down and bottom-up DP solutions, the time complexity is O(N * T) and the space complexity is O(T).

#### [LC-198:House Robber](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/)
##### Solution Explanation:
```
Solution Approach:
-----------------------------------
Bottom-Up DP 2 ways:
-----------------------------------
1) Iterative + memo (bottom-up)
2) Iterative + N variables (bottom-up)

NOTE: For interview situation use method (2) => rob_iteratively_with_variables()
=================================================================================================================================================================

This particular problem and most of others can be approached using the following sequence:

  1. Find recursive relation
  2. Recursive (top-down)
  3. Recursive + memo (top-down)
  4. Iterative + memo (bottom-up)
  5. Iterative + N variables (bottom-up)

Step 1> Figure out recursive relation.
------------------------------------------------
A robber has 2 options: a) rob current house i; b) don't rob current house.
If an option "a" is selected it means she can't rob previous i-1 house but can safely proceed to the one before previous i-2 and gets all cumulative loot that follows.
If an option "b" is selected the robber gets all the possible loot from robbery of i-1 and all the following buildings.
So it boils down to calculating what is more profitable:

robbery of current house + loot from houses before the previous
loot from the previous house robbery and any loot captured before that


rob(i) = Math.max( rob(i - 2) + currentHouseValue, rob(i - 1) )

Step 2. Recursive (top-down)
------------------------------------------------

public int rob(int[] nums) {
    return rob(nums, nums.length - 1);
}
private int rob(int[] nums, int i) {
    if (i < 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    return Math.max(rob(nums, i - 2) + nums[i], rob(nums, i - 1));
}

Step 3. Recursive + memo (top-down).
------------------------------------------------

int[] memo;
public int rob(int[] nums) {
    memo = new int[nums.length + 1];
    Arrays.fill(memo, -1);
    return rob(nums, nums.length - 1);
}

private int rob(int[] nums, int i) {
    if (i < 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    if (memo[i] >= 0) {
        return memo[i];
    }
    int result = Math.max(rob(nums, i - 2) + nums[i], rob(nums, i - 1));
    memo[i] = result;
    return result;
}

Much better, this should run in O(n) time. Space complexity is O(n) as well, because of the recursion stack, let's try to get rid of it.


Step 4. Iterative + memo (bottom-up)
------------------------------------------------
public int rob(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int[] memo = new int[nums.length + 1];
    memo[0] = 0;
    memo[1] = nums[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int val = nums[i];
        memo[i+1] = Math.max(memo[i], memo[i-1] + val);
    }
    return memo[nums.length];
}


Step 5. Iterative + 2 variables (bottom-up)
------------------------------------------------
We can notice that in the previous step we use only memo[i] and memo[i-1], so going just 2 steps back. We can hold them in 2 variables instead.
This optimization is met in Fibonacci sequence creation and some other problems.

/* the order is: prev2, prev1, num  */
public int rob(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int prev1 = 0;
    int prev2 = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        int tmp = prev1;
        prev1 = Math.max(prev2 + num, prev1);
        prev2 = tmp;
    }
    return prev1;
}
```
##### Complexity Analysis:

SPACE COMPLEXITY : O(1)

#### [LC-213:House Robber II](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-ii/)
##### Solution Explanation:
```
Solution Approach:
-----------------------------------
Bottom-Up DP => Iterative + N variables (bottom-up)

Variant of [ House Robber | LeetCode Problem 198 | https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/ ] ... can be solved by just calling the solution for LC-198 twice.
=================================================================================================================================================================
This problem can be seen as follow-up question for problem 198. House Robber. 

If thief choose to rob first house, then thief cannot rob last house. Simiarly, if choose to rob last house, then cannot rob first.
So if we are given houses [1,3,4,5,6,7], then we are taking max from:
1.[1,3,4,5,6] OR
2.[3,4,5,6,7]

whichever's max value is larger.
So we just do 2 pass of dp and take the larger one. And the problem is reduced to House Robber I [ House Robber | LeetCode Problem 198 | https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/ ].
```
##### Complexity Analysis:
```
Time Complexity: time complexity is O(n), because we use dp problem with complexity O(n) twice. 
Space complexity is O(1), because in python lists passed by reference and space complexity of House Robber problem is O(1).

TIME COMPLEXITY  : O(N)
SPACE COMPLEXITY : O(1)

#### [LC-91:Decode Ways](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-ways/)
##### Solution Explanation:
```
DP Approach 1>
------------------
Use a dp array of size n + 1 to save subproblem solutions.

dp[0] means an empty string will have one way to decode,
dp[1] means the way to decode a string of size 1.

Check one digit and two digit combination and save the results along the way.

In the end, dp[n] will be the end result.

For example:
s = "231"
index 0: extra base offset. dp[0] = 1
index 1: # of ways to parse "2" => dp[1] = 1
index 2: # of ways to parse "23" => "2" and "23", dp[2] = 2
index 3: # of ways to parse "231" => "2 3 1" and "23 1" => dp[3] = 2

DP Approach 2> ( SPACE OPTIMIZATION - Constant Space )
------------------
We can use two variables to store the previous results.
Since we only use dp[i-1] and dp[i-2] to compute dp[i]. 
Why not just use two variable prev1, prev2 instead?
This can reduce the space to O(1)
```

#### [LC-62:Unique Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/)
##### Solution Explanation:
```
Solution Approach:
=================================================================================================================================================================
DP without Recursion + Space Optimization

- path[i,j] = Number of paths from [0,0] to [i,j].
- path[0,j] = 1 and path[i,0] = 1
- path[i,j] = path[i,j-1] + path[i-1,j]
- return path[m-1, n-1]
- We can start from row 1 and column 1 after initializing the path matrix to 1.

Time and Space complexity: O(MN)

- Space Optimization: Instead of 2D matrix, a single array can do the job and reduce space complexity to O(N)

#### [LC-55:Jump Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/)
##### Solution Explanation:
```
Solution Approach:
=================================================================================================================================================================
Greedy Algorithm

Greedy -- Reach means last num's maximum reach position.
If current index > reach, then means can't reach current position from last number.

1. We start travering the array from start
2. While traversing, we keep a track on maximum reachable index and update it accordingly. 
3. If we cannot reach the maxium reachable index we get out of loop ( If current index > reach, then means can't reach current position from last number ).

Idea
----------------
Turns out that maintaining a dictionary/hashmap that associates origianl node to its clone {node: clone_node} 
makes this process very simple. 
This hashmap also serves as a visited set to make sure you don't loop indefinitely while DFS/BFS.

#### [LC-207:Course Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/)
##### Solution Explanation:
```
----------------------------------
BFS with Kahn's algorithm
----------------------------------
One of these algorithms, first described by Kahn (1962), works by choosing vertices in the same order as the eventual topological sort. 
First, find a list of "start nodes" which have no incoming edges and insert them into a set S; at least one such node must exist in a non-empty acyclic graph.
Then:
----------------------------------
L ← Empty list that will contain the sorted elements
S ← Set of all nodes with no incoming edge
while S is non-empty do
    remove a node n from S
    add n to tail of L
    for each node m with an edge e from n to m do
        remove edge e from the graph
        if m has no other incoming edges then
            insert m into S
if graph has edges then
    return error   (graph has at least one cycle)
else 
    return L   (a topologically sorted order)


----------------------------------
DFS with Tarjan Algorithm
----------------------------------

An alternative algorithm for topological sorting is based on depth-first search. The algorithm loops through each node of the graph,
in an arbitrary order, initiating a depth-first search that terminates when it hits any node that has already been visited 
since the beginning of the topological sort or the node has no outgoing edges (i.e. a leaf node):
----------------------------------
L ← Empty list that will contain the sorted nodes
while there are unmarked nodes do
    select an unmarked node n
    visit(n)

function visit(node n)
    if n has a permanent mark then return
    if n has a temporary mark then stop   (not a DAG)
    mark n temporarily
    for each node m with an edge from n to m do
        visit(m)
    mark n permanently
    add n to head of L

##### Complexity Analysis:
```
DFS ( Tarjan's Algorithm )
---------------
TIME COMPLEXITY  : O(V + E) => As all it does is basically run a DFS. 
                               However this asymptotic analysis assumes that looking up a vertex in a stack can be done in constant time.

SPACE COMPLEXITY : O(N)     => The space complexity is linear as it makes use of additional space for the stack.

BFS ( Kahn's Algorithm )
---------------
TIME COMPLEXITY  : O(V + E) => Since we're using an adjacency list.
                               Each edge and vertex will only be visited once throughout the main loop logic.

SPACE COMPLEXITY : O(V + E) => For the adjacency list.

#### [LC-417:Pacific Atlantic Water Flow](https://leetcode.com/problems/pacific-atlantic-water-flow/)
##### Solution Explanation:
```
=================================================================================================================================================================
Solution Approach:
=================================================================================================================================================================
In a naive approach, we would have to consider each cell and find if it is reachable to both the oceans by checking if it is able to reach - 
1) top or left edge(atlantic) and, 
2) bottom or right edge (pacific). This would take about O((mn)^2), which is not efficient.


We can observe that there are these cells which can reach -

 - None
 - Pacific
 - Atlantic
 - Both Pacific and Atlantic

We need only the cells satisfying the last condition above ( i.e., "Both Pacific and Atlantic" ).

- Now, if we start from the cells connected to altantic ocean and visit all cells having height greater than current cell 
(water can only flow from a cell to another one with height equal or lower), we are able to reach some subset of cells (let's call them A).

- Next, we start from the cells connected to pacific ocean and repeat the same process, we find another subset (let's call this one B).

- The final answer we get will be the intersection of sets A and B (A ∩ B).

So, we just need to iterate from edge cells, find cells reachable from atlantic (set A), 
cells reachable from pacific (set B) and return their intersection.

This can be done using DFS or BFS graph traversals.
```
##### Complexity Analysis:
```
For both DFS and BFS graph traversal approaches:

Time Complexity : O(M*N), in worst case, all cells are reachable to both oceans and would be visited twice. This case can occur when all elements are equal.
Space Complexity : O(M*N), to mark the atlantic and pacific visited cells.

#### [LC-200:Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)
##### Solution Explanation:
```
Solution Approach:
DFS ( Recursion )
=================================================================================================================================================================
1. Scan grid - nested for loop
2. If cell = 1, piece of land -> pass into recursive dfs and consume/drown the land
3. Increment counter
4. Pass grid into recursive - state of grid changes - to avoid double counting

#### [LC-128:Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/)
##### Solution Explanation:
```
=================================================================================================================================================================
Solution Approach:
=================================================================================================================================================================
DFS

We can think this is a undirectional graph: every number i is connected with its two adjacent numbers i-1, i+1.
So that we can start from a number in the input (convert input to be a set so that look up a number whether in the set has O(1) complexity),
use DFS to traverse the whole graph.

Visited numbers are removed from the set so that we don't revisit one number twice.
```
##### Complexity Analysis:
```
Time Complexity   : O(N)
Space Complexity  : O(N)
```
```python
from typing import List, Set

def dfs(numSet: Set[int], root: int, size: List[int]):
    if root-1 in numSet:
        size[0]+= 1
        numSet.remove(root-1) #mark it as visited when check the neighbor
        dfs(numSet, root-1, size)
    if root+1 in numSet:
        size[0]+= 1
        numSet.remove(root+1)
        dfs(numSet, root+1, size)

def longestConsecutive(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    if not nums:
        return 0
        
    numSet = set(nums)
    max_length = 1
    while numSet:
        size=[1]
        current= numSet.pop()
        dfs(numSet, current, size)
        max_length= max(max_length, size[0])
    return max_length

if __name__ == "__main__":
    #Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
    #Output: 4
    #Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
    nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
    print(longestConsecutive(nums))
```
```kotlin
fun <T> MutableSet<T>.pop(): T? = this.first().also{this.remove(it)}

fun dfs(numSet: MutableSet<Int>, root: Int, size: IntArray) {
    if (root-1 in numSet) {
        size[0] += 1
        numSet.remove(root-1) //mark it as visited when check the neighbor
        dfs(numSet, root-1, size)
    }
    if (root+1 in numSet) {
        size[0] += 1
        numSet.remove(root+1)
        dfs(numSet, root+1, size)
    }
}

#### [LC-269:Alien Dictionary](https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/)
##### Solution Explanation:
```
BFS

------------------------
Thought process:
------------------------
Topological sort:
------------------------
Topological sort:
1. Build graph: 
   1.1 a map of character -> set of character.
   1.2 Also get in-degrees for each character. In-degrees will be a map of character -> integer.
2. Topological sort:
   2.1 Loop through in-degrees. Offer the characters with in-degree of 0 to queue.
   2.2 While queue is not empty:
       2.2.1 Poll from queue. Append to character to result string.
       2.2.2 Decrease the in-degree of polled character's children by 1.
       2.2.3 If any child's in-degree decreases to 0, offer it to queue.
3. At last, if result string's length is less than the number of vertices, that means there is a cycle in my graph. The order is invalid.
```
##### Complexity Analysis:
```
Time Complexity   : O(N)

- Say the number of characters in the dictionary (including duplicates) is N.
- Building the graph takes O(N).
- Topological sort takes O(V + E). V <= N.
- E also can't be larger than N.
- So the overall time complexity is O(n).

#### [LC-261:Graph Valid Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/graph-valid-tree/)
##### Solution Explanation:
```
DFS

A tree is a special undirected graph. It satisfy two properties :
1. It is connected
2. It has no cycle.

Being connected means you can start from any node and reach any other node. 
- To prove it, we can do a DFS and add each node we visit to a set. 
- After we visited all the nodes, we compare the number of nodes in the set with the total number of nodes. 
- If they are the same then every node is accessible from any other node and the graph is connected.

To prove an undirected graph having no cycle, we can also do a DFS.
- If a graph contains a cycle, then we would visit a certain node more than once.
- There is a minor caveat, since the graph is undirected, when we visit a child we would always add parent to the next visit list. 
- This creates a trivial cycle and not the real cycle we want.
- We can avoid detecting trivial cycle but adding an additional parent state in the DFS call.

We can check both properties in one DFS call since cycle detection always keeps track of a visited set.

#### [LC-323:Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-connected-components-in-an-undirected-graph/)
##### Solution Explanation:
```
BFS
---------
- Start from index 0 to n.
- For each index : 
  - use BFS to find all it’s related numbers
  - append them to the visited set
  - if this index has no more related numbers then increment count ( count = count + 1 )
    and 
  - start from next index
  - note that if the index is in visited set. we skip to next index

```

#### [LC-56:Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)
##### Solution Explanation:
```
=================================================================================================================================================================
Solution Approach:
=================================================================================================================================================================
- if the list of merged intervals is empty 
  or if the current interval does not overlap with the previous,
  - simply append it.
- otherwise, there is overlap,
  - so we merge the current and previous intervals.
```
##### Complexity Analysis:
```
TC: O(N*log(N))
----------------
In python, use sort method to a list costs O(nlogn), where n is the length of the list.
The for-loop used to merge intervals, costs O(n).
O(nlogn)+O(n) = O(nlogn)
So the total time complexity is O(nlogn).

SC: O(N)
---------------
The algorithm used a merged list and a variable i.
In the worst case, the merged list is equal to the length of the input intervals list. So the space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input list.

#### [LC-435:Non-overlapping Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/)
##### Solution Explanation:
```
=================================================================================================================================================================
Solution Approach:
Greedy Algorithm
=================================================================================================================================================================
A classic greedy case: interval scheduling problem.

The heuristic is: always pick the interval with the earliest end time. Then you can get the maximal number of non-overlapping intervals. (or minimal number to remove).
This is because, the interval with the earliest end time produces the maximal capacity to hold rest intervals.
E.g. Suppose current earliest end time of the rest intervals is x. Then available time slot left for other intervals is [x:]. If we choose another interval with end time y, then available time slot would be [y:]. Since x ≤ y, there is no way [y:] can hold more intervals then [x:]. Thus, the heuristic holds.

Therefore, we can sort interval by ending time and key track of current earliest end time. Once next interval's start time is earlier than current end time, then we have to remove one interval. Otherwise, we update earliest end time.
```

TC: O(N*log(N))

Time complexity is O(NlogN) as sort overwhelms greedy search.

#### [LC-252:Meeting Rooms](https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms/)
##### Solution Explanation:
```
=================================================================================================================================================================
Solution Approach:
=================================================================================================================================================================
- If a person can attend all meetings, there must not be any overlaps between any meetings.
- After sorting the intervals, we can compare the current end and next start.
```
##### Complexity Analysis:
```
TC: O(N*log(N))

Time complexity is O(NlogN) because of sort.

SC: O(N)
```
```python
from typing import List

def canAttendMeetings(intervals: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
        if intervals[i][0] < intervals[i-1][1]:
            return False
    return True
```
```kotlin
fun canAttendMeetings(intervals: Array<IntArray>): Boolean {
    intervals.sortWith(compareBy({it[0]}, {-it[1]}))

    for (i in 1..intervals.size - 1) {
        if (intervals[i][0] < intervals[i-1][1]) return false
    }
        
    return true
}

#### [LC-253:Meeting Rooms II](https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-ii/)
##### Solution Explanation:
```
=================================================================================================================================================================
Solution Approach:
=================================================================================================================================================================
When a room is taken, the room can not be used for anther meeting until the current meeting is over.
As soon as the current meeting is finished, the room can be used for another meeting.

- We still need to sort the intervals by start time in order to make things easier
- A very straightforward way is to have a List of Interval and stored as the occupied interval of a room.
- And the size of the List will be the number of rooms required.

- Because the start time is in increasing order, so that when you found a meeting that needs to be put into one room, 
  it doesn't matter which available room to put in.
- E.g. if there are three rooms can support a meeting at 1pm and the end time of three rooms are 9 am , 10 am and 11 am.
- We can arrange this meeting at 1pm to any of the three. Because we know the next (if has next) meeting will start later than 1pm.
- No matter where we put 1pm meeting, we will have only two rooms available for the later ones.

#### [LC-206:Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)
##### Solution Explanation:
```
=================================================================================================================================================================
Intuition
=================================================================================================================================================================
To reverse a linked list, we actually reverse the direction of every next pointer.
For example, we reverse a linked list 1->2->3->4->5 by changing every -> to <- and get the result as 1<-2<-3<-4<-5. And we need to return the pointer to 5 instead of to 1.
To solve it efficiently, we can do it in one loop iteration or recursion.

=================================================================================================================================================================
Iterative Solution Approach:
=================================================================================================================================================================

- For iteration, we create a ListNode rev to keep track of what we have reversed otherwise we would lose it.
- Then we iterate linked list and make head point to the current node.
- We change a -> to <- by calling head.next = rev, update rev by calling rev = head, move to next node by calling head = head.next.
- To save a temporary variable, we could assign these variables in one line, but head.next and rev should be updated 
  before head is updated otherwise direction would not be reversed and rev would keep pointing to itself.
- For example, 1->2->3, 1 is current node head, what we have reversed rev is None, 2 is head.next.
- Calling head.next = rev leads to None<-1. Calling head = head.next concurrently to make head pointing to 2->3.
- Updating rev as 1->None. And in next iteration, we will change 2->3 to 1<-2 and keep changing -> to <- so on so forth.

=================================================================================================================================================================
Recursive Solution Approach:
=================================================================================================================================================================

- For recursion, the bottom layer is the end of the origin linked list so we just return it.
- For the outer layer, for example, 4->5, we change -> to <- by calling head.next.next = head where head points at 4 
  and head.next points at 5. node, which is self.reverseList(head.next) also points at 5 or 5->4, is what we need to return in this layer.
- So when we keep returning to the outer layer, reversed linked list keep growing (a -> b becomes a <- b as head.next.next = head)
- Another example, in some recursion, you have linked list 1->2->3->null, reversed linked list 5->4->3->null.
  head points at 2, head.next points at 3, 5->4->3->null is what you have reversed and stored in node=reversedList(head.next).
- Now you need to place 2 to the end of 5->4->3. So you call head.next.next = head or 3.next = 2, and head.next = null or 2.next = null.
- Then you have original linked list 1->2->null, and reversed linked list (head node 5 stored in node) 5->4->3->2->null.
- Then you return these to outer recursion.
```
##### Complexity Analysis:
```
One thing should be notice that we should always be fully aware of what a variable points at. The rev and reverseList_Recu(node) point at the head of the reversed linked list while the current node head that we are visiting in origin linked list point at the tail of the reversed linked list.
Both methods take a liner scan without extra space. So time complexity is O(n) and space is O(1).

**************************************************************************
Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm
**************************************************************************
This is the fastest method to solve this problem and has been described below:
  * Traverse linked list using two pointers.
  * Move one pointer(slow) by one and another pointer(fast) by two.
  * If these pointers meet at the same node then there is a loop. If pointers do not meet then linked list
    doesn’t have a loop.
  * Below image shows how the detectloop function works in the code :

Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm
--------------------------------
In simple terms it is also known as "Tortoise and Hare Algorithm" or "Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm" 
named after its inventor Robert Floyd. It is one of the simple cycle detection algorithm. It's a simple pointers based approach.


Let us take 2 pointers namely slow Pointer and fast Pointer to traverse a Singly Linked List at different speeds. 
A slow Pointer (Also called Tortoise) moves one step forward while fast Pointer (Also called Hare) moves 2 steps forward
 1. Start Tortoise and Hare at the first node of the List.
 2. If Hare reaches end of the List, return as there is no loop in the list.
 3. Else move Hare one step forward.
 4. If Hare reaches end of the List, return as there is no loop in the list.
 5. Else move Hare and Tortoise one step forward.
 6. If Hare and Tortoise pointing to same Node return, we found loop in the List.
 7. Else start with STEP-2.

Pseudocode:
-------------
tortoise := firstNode
hare := firstNode

forever:

  if hare == end 
    return 'No Loop Found'

  hare := hare.next

  if hare == end
    return 'No Loop Found'

  hare = hare.next
  tortoise = tortoise.next

  if hare == tortoise
    return 'Loop Found'
-------------

Q> Why can't we let the Hare go by itself like Tortoise ?
A> If there is a loop, Hare would just go forever. Tortoise ensures that you will only take 'n' steps atmost.

Q> How to find the length of the Loop ?
A> Once Hare and Tortoise finds the loop in a Singly linked List move Tortoise one step forward everytime maintaining the count of the nodes until it reaches the Hare again.
```
##### Complexity Analysis:
```
Time Complexity: O(N)
Space Complexity: O(1)

To calculate the Time Complexity the shape of the cycle doesn't matter.
It can have a long tail, 
and a loop towards the end or just a loop from the beginning to the end without a tail. 
Irrespective of the shape of the cycle, one thing is clear - that the Tortoise can never catch up with the Hare.
If the two has to meet, the Hare has to catch up with the Tortoise from behind.

With that established, consider the two possibilities
 Case-1) Hare is one step behind Tortoise
 Case-2) Hare is two step behind Tortoise

All greater distances will reduce to One or Two. Let us assume always Tortoise moves first  (it could be even other way).

Case-1:
-------
In the first case were the distance between Hare and Tortoise is one step.
 - Tortoise moves one step forward and the distance  between Hare and Tortoise becomes 2.
 - Now Hare moves 2 steps forward meeting up with Tortoise.

Case-2:
-------
In the second case were the distance between Hare and Tortoise is two steps.
 - Tortoise moves one step forward and the distance between Hare and Tortoise becomes 3.
 - Now Hare moved 2 steps forward which makes the distance between Hare and Tortoise as 1. 

It is similar to first case which we already proved that both Hare and Tortoise will meet up in next step.

Let the length of the loop be 'n' and there are 'p' variables before the loop.
Hare traverses the loop twice in 'n' moves, they are guaranteed to meet in O(n).

#### [LC-21:Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)
##### Python Learning Points:
```
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58715870/explanation-about-dummy-nodes-and-pointers-in-linked-lists
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The crucial thing here is that when you set a Python variable to an object, it's a pointer, not a value. So in this code here:

dummy = cur = ListNode(0)
# cur = 0
# dummy = 0
dummy and cur both point to the same object (i.e. the same single-element list). When you append your other list to cur, you're simultaneously appending it to dummy because it's the same list.

When you do this:

cur = cur.next
# cur = 1->4->5
# dummy = 0->1->4->5
you're not creating a new list, you're just iterating your cur pointer down the existing list. Both pointers are part of the same list, but dummy points to the first element and cur points to the second element.

Each time you call ListNode() you're creating a new node, so if you want to create two nodes with the same value, you need to call the initializer twice:

dummy = ListNode(0)
cur = ListNode(0)
# cur and dummy both have values of 0, but they're different list objects!
```
##### Learning From Youtube Video Solutions:
```
Linkedlists can be confusing especially if you've recently started to code but (I think) once you understand it fully, it should not be that difficult.

For this problem, I'm going to explain several ways of solving it BUT I want to make something clear. 
Something that you've seen a lot of times in the posts on this website but probably haven't fully understood. dummy variable!
It has been used significantly in the solutions of this problem and not well explained for a newbie level coder!
The idea is we're dealing with pointers that point to a memory location! Think of it this way!
You want to find gold that is hidden somewhere. Someone has put a set of clues in a sequence!
Meaning, if you find the first clue and solve the problem hidden in the clue, you will get to the second clue!
Solving the hidden problem of second clue will get you to the thrid clue, and so on!
If you keep solving, you'll get to the gold! dummy helps you to find the first clue!!!!

Throughout the solution below, you'll be asking yourself why dummy is not changing and we eventually return dummy.next????
It doesn't make sense, right?
However, if you think that dummy is pointing to the start and there is another variable (temp) that makes the linkes from node to node,
you'll have a better feeling!
Similar to the gold example if I tell you the first clue is at location X, then, you can solve clues sequentially 
(because of course you're smart) and bingo! you find the gold! Watch this.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3O_f_sk3mFc

This video shows why we need the dummy!
Since we're traversing using temp but once temp gets to the tail of the sorted merged linkedlist,
there's no way back to the start of the list to return as a result! So dummy to the rescue!
it does not get changed throughout the list traversals temp is doing!
So, dummy makes sure we don't loose the head of the thread (result list).
Does this make sense? Alright! Enough with dummy!

I think if you get this, the first solution feels natural! Now, watch this. You got the idea?? Nice!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfRQvf7MB3k
```
##### Solution Explanation:
```
1) Iterative Solution
----------------------
First you initialize dummy and temp.
One is sitting at the start of the linkedlist and the other (temp) is going to move forward find which value 
should be added to the list. Note that it's initialized with a value 0 but it can be anything! 
You initialize it with your value of choice! Doesn't matter since we're going to finally return dummy.next which disregards 0 
that we used to start the linkedlist. 

- Line #1 makes sure none of the l1 and l2 are empty!
- If one of them is empty, we should return the other! If both are nonempty, we check val of each of them to add the smaller 
  one to the result linkedlist!
- In line #2, l1.val is smaller and we want to add it to the list.
- How? We use temp POINTER (it's pointer, remember that!).
- Since we initialized temp to have value 0 at first node, we use temp.next to point 0 to the next value we're going 
  to add to the list l1.val (line #3). Once we do that, we update l1 to go to the next node of l1.
- If the if statement of line #2 doesn't work, we do similar stuff with l2. And finally, if the length of l1 and l2 are not the same,
  we're going to the end of one of them at some point!
- Line #5 adds whatever left from whatever linkedlist to the temp.next (check the above video for a great explanation of this part).
- Note that both linkedlists were sorted initially. Also, this line takes care of when one of the linkedlists are empty.
- Finally, we return dummy.next since dummy is pointing to 0 and next to zero is what we've added throughout the process.
----------------------
2) Recursive Solution
----------------------
Another way of solving is problem is by doing recursion. This is from here (https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/discuss/9735/Python-solutions-(iteratively-recursively-iteratively-in-place)).
- The first check is obvious! If one of them is empty, return the other one!
- Similar to line #5 of previous solution.
- Here, we have two cases, whatever list has the smaller first element (equal elements also satisfies line #1),
  will be returned at the end. In the example l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4], we go in the if statement of line #1 first,
  this means that the first element of l1 doesn't get changed!
- Then, we move the pointer to the second element of l1 by calling the function again but with l1.next and l2 as input!
- This round of call, goes to line #2 because now we have element 1 from l2 versus 2 from l1.
- Now, basically, l2 gets connected to the tail of l1. We keep moving forward by switching between l1 and l2 until the last element.
- Sorry if it's not clear enough! I'm not a fan of recursion for such a problems!
- But, let me know which part it's hard to understand, I'll try to explain better!

#### [LC-23:Merge k Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/)
##### Data Structure Learning Points - What is a Priority Queue ?
```
In computer science, a priority queue is an abstract data type similar to a regular queue or stack data structure in which each element additionally 
has a "priority" associated with it. In a priority queue, an element with high priority is served before an element with low priority.
In some implementations, if two elements have the same priority, they are served according to the order in which they were enqueued,
while in other implementations, ordering of elements with the same priority is undefined.

While priority queues are often implemented with heaps, they are conceptually distinct from heaps.
A priority queue is a concept like "a list" or "a map"; just as a list can be implemented with a linked list or an array,
a priority queue can be implemented with a heap or a variety of other methods such as an unordered array.
```
##### Interview Note
```
In an interview situation, use "Approach 2: Merge with Divide And Conquer".
This is what an interviewer expects.
```
##### Solution Explanation:
```
----------------------------------------------------
Approach 1: Compare one-by-one using Priority Queue
----------------------------------------------------

Algorithm

- Compare every k nodes (head of every linked list) and get the node with the smallest value.
- Extend the final sorted linked list with the selected nodes.
- Optimize the comparison process by using a priority queue data structure.

----------------------------------------------------
Approach 2: Merge with Divide And Conquer
----------------------------------------------------

Intuition & Algorithm
----------------------
We don't need to traverse most nodes many times repeatedly

 - Pair up k lists and merge each pair.
 - After the first pairing, k lists are merged into k/2 lists with average 2N/k length,
   then k/4, k/8 and so on.
 - Repeat this procedure until we get the final sorted linked list.

Thus, we'll traverse almost NN nodes per pairing and merging, and repeat this procedure about log2(k) times.

#### [LC-19:Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)
##### Solution Explanation:
```
Solution - I (One-Pointer, Two-Pass)
---------------------------------------------------
This approach is very intuitive and easy to get.
  - We just iterate in the first-pass to find the length of the linked list - len.
  - In the next pass, iterate len - n - 1 nodes from start and delete the next node (which would be nth node from end).
  
Solution (Two-Pointer, One-Pass)
---------------------------------------------------
We are required to remove the nth node from the end of list.
For this, we need to traverse N - n nodes from the start of the list,
where N is the length of linked list.
We can do this in one-pass as follows:

  - Let's assign two pointers - fast and slow to head.
    We will first iterate for n nodes from start using the fast pointer.

  - Now, between the fast and slow pointers, there is a gap of n nodes.
    Now, just Iterate and increment both the pointers till fast reaches the last node.
	The gap between fast and slow is still of n nodes, meaning that slow is nth node from the last node (which currently is fast).

For eg. let the list be 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9, and n = 4.

1. 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> null
   ^slow               ^fast
   |<--gap of n nodes-->|
 
 => Now traverse till fast reaches end
 
 2. 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> null
                        ^slow               ^fast
                        |<--gap of n nodes-->|
						
'slow' is at (n+1)th node from end.
So just delete nth node from end by assigning slow -> next as slow -> next -> next (which would remove nth node from end of list).

  - Since we have to delete the nth node from end of list (And not nth from the last of list!),
    we just delete the next node to slow pointer and return the head.

```
##### Complexity Analysis:
```
Solution - I (One-Pointer, Two-Pass)
---------------------------------------------------
Time Complexity : O(N), where, N is the number of nodes in the given list.
Space Complexity : O(1), since only constant space is used.

Solution (Two-Pointer, One-Pass)
---------------------------------------------------
Time Complexity : O(N), where, N is the number of nodes in the given list. Although, the time complexity is same as above solution, we have reduced the constant factor in it to half.
Space Complexity : O(1), since only constant space is used.
```
##
```
Note : The Problem only asks us to remove the node from the linked list and not delete it.
A good question to ask in an interview for this problem would be whether we just need to remove the node from linked list or completely delete it from the memory.
Since it has not been stated in this problem if the node is required somewhere else later on, its better to just remove the node from linked list as asked.

#### [LC-143:Reorder List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/)
##### Solution Explanation:
```
If you never solved singly linked lists problems before, or you do not have a lot of experience, this problem can be quite difficult.
However if you already know all the tricks, it is not difficult at all.
Let us first try to understand what we need to do.
For list [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] we need to return [1,7,2,6,3,5,4]
 We can note, that it is actually two lists [1,2,3,4] and [7,6,5], where elements are interchange.
So, to succeed we need to do the following steps:

 1. Find the middle of or list - be careful, it needs to work properly both for even and for odd number of nodes.
    For this we can either just count number of elements and then divide it by to, and do two traversals of list. 
    Or we can use slow/fast iterators trick, where slow moves with speed 1 and fast moves with speed 2.
    Then when fast reches the end, slow will be in the middle, as we need.
 2. Reverse the second part of linked list. Again, if you never done it before, it can be quite painful, 
    please read oficial solution to problem 206. Reverse Linked List. The idea is to keep three pointers: 
    prev, curr, nextt stand for previous, current and next and change connections in place.
    Do not forget to use slow.next = None, in opposite case you will have list with loop.
 3. Finally, we need to merge two lists, given its heads. These heads are denoted by head and prev, so for simplicity 
    I created head1 and head2 variables. What we need to do now is to interchange nodes: we put head2 
    as next element of head1 and then say that head1 is now head2 and head2 is previous head1.next.
    In this way we do one step for one of the lists and rename lists, 
    so next time we will take element from head2, then rename again and so on.
```
##### Complexity Analysis:
```
TC: O(N)
SC: O(1)

Time Complexity: Time complexity is O(n), because we first do O(n) iterations to find middle, then we do O(n) iterations to reverse second half 
and finally we do O(n) iterations to merge lists. 

Space complexity is O(1).

From doing that, you'll notice that we want a way to know when each row and col should be changed to zero.
We don't want to prematurely change the values in the matrix to zero because as we go through it, we might change a row to 0 because of the new value.

Time Complexity: O(m*n(m+n))
===========================================
Because we are not tracking the rows and columns which we have already set to 0. In the worst case, every element in original matrix would be 0.

===========================================
Approach-1
===========================================
More optimized using O(m + n) space: 
===========================================
Intuition
-------------------------------------------
If any cell of the matrix has a zero we can record its row and column number. 
All the cells of this recorded row and column can be marked zero in the next iteration.
-------------------------------------------

To do better, we want O(m + n). How do we go about that? Well, we really just need a way to track if any row or any col has a zero,
because then that means the entire row or col has to be zero. Ok, well, then we can use an array to track the zeroes for the row and zeros for the col. 
Whenever we see a zero, just set that row or col to be True.

Space: O(m + n) for the zeroes_row and zeroes_col array.

===========================================
Approach-2
===========================================
Most optimized using O(1) space: 
===========================================
Intuition
-------------------------------------------
Rather than using additional variables to keep track of rows and columns to be reset,
we use the matrix itself as the indicators.
-------------------------------------------

But, we can do even better, O(1) - initial ask of the problem.
What if instead of having a separate array to track the zeroes, we simply use the first row or col to track them 
and then go back to update the first row and col with zeroes after we're done replacing it?
The approach to get constant space is to use first row and first col of the matrix as a tracker.

At each row or col, if you see a zero, then mark the first row or first col as zero with the current row and col.
Then iterate through the array again to see where the first row and col were marked as zero and then set that row/col as 0.
After doing that, you'll need to traverse through the first row and/or first col 
if there were any zeroes there to begin with and set everything to be equal to 0 in the first row and/or first col.

Time complexity for all Solutions 1 and 2 is O(m * n).

Space: O(1) for modification in place and using the first row and first col to keep track of zeros instead of zeroes_row and zeroes_col
```

#### [LC-54:Spiral Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix/)
##### Solution Explanation:
```
##############################################
Approach-1: Simulation
##############################################
Intuition
----------------------------------------------
Draw the path that the spiral makes. We know that the path should turn clockwise
whenever it would go out of bounds or into a cell that was previously visited.
----------------------------------------------
Algorithm
----------------------------------------------
We simulate how a person would draw a spiral path through the matrix. This solution uses 4 boundary pointers to iterate through the matrix in a spiral fashion.

We move in set order of directions and make a small adjustment to change direction. The implementation is tedious. I have provided a visual walkthrough below.

1. from first_row go left last_col bounary hit then adjust first_row boundary
2. from last_col go down until last_row bounary hit then adjust last_col boundary
3. from last_row go right until first_col boundary hit then adjust last_row boundary
4. from first_col up until first_row boundary hit then adjust first_col boundary

We always follow this same procedure. When any boundary overlaps we are finished.

After each loop a boundary is adjusted. that is why there are explicit conditionals to make sure the indexes do not go out of bounds.
----------------------------------------------
Visual Walkthrough
----------------------------------------------
These diagrams show the adjustment of the boundaries after we iterate through a row or a column.

Approach-2: Layer-By-Layer
##############################################
Intuition
----------------------------------------------
The idea is to peel the the matrix layer by layer.

The answer will be all the elements in clockwise order from the first-outer layer,
followed by the elements from the second-outer layer, and so on.
----------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------
Algorithm
----------------------------------------------
We define the k-th outer layer of a matrix as all elements that have minimum distance 
to some border equal to k. For example, the following matrix has all elements in the 
first-outer layer equal to 1, all elements in the second-outer layer equal to 2,
and all elements in the third-outer layer equal to 3.

[[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
 [1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1],
 [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1],
 [1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1],
 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]
 
For each outer layer, we want to iterate through its elements in clockwise order starting from the top left corner.
Suppose the current outer layer has top-left coordinates (r1, c1) 
and bottom-right coordinates (r2, c2).

Then, the top row is the set of elements (r1, c) for c = c1,...,c2, in that order.
The rest of the right side is the set of elements (r, c2) for r = r1+1,...,r2, in that order.
Then, if there are four sides to this layer (ie., r1 < r2 and c1 < c2),
we iterate through the bottom side and left side as shown in the solutions below.

[[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],          top: c from c1 ... c2
 [1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1],          right: r from r1+1 ... r2
 [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1],          bottom: c from c2+1 ... c1+2
 [1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1],          left: r from r2+1 ... r1+1
 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]

##### Bonus Question:
```
Bonus Question: If you're not too confident with matrices and linear algebra, get some more practice by also coding a method that 
transposes the matrix on the other diagonal, and another that reflects from top to bottom. You can test your functions by printing 
out the matrix before and after each operation. Finally, use your functions to find three more solutions to this problem.
Each solution uses two matrix operations.

             \----------+

We can iterate over each group of four cells and rotate them.
----------------------------------------------
Algorithm
----------------------------------------------
The trick here is to realize that cells in our matrix (M) can be swapped out in groups of four in a self-contained manner.
This will allow us to keep our space complexity down to O(1).

The remaining difficulty lies in setting up our nested for loops to accomplish the entirety of these four-way swaps.
If we consider each ring of data as a larger iteration, we can notice that each successive ring shortens in the length of its side by 2.
This means that we will need to perform this process to a maximum depth of floor(n / 2) times.
We can use floor here because the center cell of an odd-sided matrix will not need to be swapped.

For each ring, we'll need to perform a number of iterations equal to the length of the side minus 1,
since we will have already swapped the far corner as our first iteration.
As noticed earlier, the length of the side of a ring is shortened by 2 
for each layer of depth we've achieved (len = n - 2 * i - 1).

Inside the nested for loops, we need to perform a four-way swap between the linked cells.
In order to save on some processing, we can store the value 
of the opposite side of i (opp = n - 1 - i) as that value will be reused many times over.

NOTE:
------
Even though this approach does twice as many reads and writes as approach 1,
most people would consider it a better approach because the code is simpler,
and it is built with standard matrix operations that can be found in any matrix library.

                   O(N^2) where N is the length of each side of the matrix.

As each cell is getting read once and written once.

We perform two steps; transposing the matrix, and then reversing each row.
Transposing the matrix has a cost of O(M) [ or, O(N^2) ], because we're moving the value of each cell once.
Reversing each row also has a cost of O(M) [ or, O(N^2) ], because again we're moving the value of each cell once.

Space complexity : O(1) because we do not use any other additional data structures.

#### [LC-79:Word Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/)
##### Solution Explanation:
```
##############################################
Approach-1: DFS Backtracking Solution
##############################################
In general I think this problem do not have polynomial solution,
so we need to check a lot of possible options.
What should we use in this case: it is bruteforce, with backtracking.
Let dfs(ind, i, j) be our backtracking function, where i and j are coordinates of cell we are currently in 
and ind is index of letter in word we currently in.
Then our dfs algorithm will look like:

1. First, we have self.Found variable, which helps us to finish earlier if we already found solution.
2. Now, we check if ind is equal to k - number of symbols in word. If we reach this point, it means we found word, so we put self.Found to True and return back.
3. If we go outside our board, we return back.
4. If symbol we are currently on in words is not equal to symbol in table, we also return back.
5. Then we visit all neibours, putting board[i][j] = "#" before - we say in this way, that this cell was visited and changing it back after.

What concerns main function, we need to start dfs from every cell of our board and also I use early stopping if we already found word.

Complexity: Time complexity is potentially O(m*n*3^k), where k is length of word and m and n are sizes of our board: 
we start from all possible cells of board, and each time (except first) we can go in 3 directions (we can not go back). 
In practice however this number will be usually much smaller, because we have a lot of dead-ends. 

Space complexity is O(k) - potential size of our recursion stack.
##############################################
Approach-2: DFS Backtracking Solution w/ Pre-Check optimization
##############################################
Same as Approach-1 but with Pre-Check optimization.

Complexity is the same as Approach-1.
```
##### Complexity Analysis:
```
For both approaches:

TC : O(m*n*3^k)

Time complexity is potentially O(m*n*3^k), where k is length of word and m and n are sizes of our board: 
we start from all possible cells of board, and each time (except first) we can go in 3 directions (we can not go back). 
In practice however this number will be usually much smaller, because we have a lot of dead-ends. 

SC : O(k)

####  [LC-3:Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)
##### Solution Explanation:
```
Approach: Sliding Window Algorithm.
=================================================================================================================================================================

From the input, we can gather the following information -

1. Given data structure is a string which is a linear data structure.
2. The output must be a substring - a part of the given string.
3. Naive solution is to check for each combination of characters in the string

Are you thinking what I am thinking 🤔 ? 
Yes, this is a classic example of a problem that can be solved using the legendary technique - Sliding Window Algorithm.

Following are the steps that we will follow -

1. Have two pointers which will define the starting index start and ending index end of the current window. Both will be 0 at the beginning.
2. Declare a Set that will store all the unique characters that we have encountered.
3. Declare a variable maxLength that will keep track of the length of the longest valid substring.
4. Scan the string from left to right one character at a time.
5. If the character has not encountered before i.e., not present in the Set the we will add it and increment the end index. The maxLength will be the maximum of Set.size() and existing maxLength.
6. If the character has encounter before, i.e., present in the Set, we will increment the start and we will remove the character at start index of the string.
7. Steps #5 and #6 are moving the window.
8. After the loop terminates, return maxLength.
```
##### Complexity Analysis:
```
a) Time  : O(N)
============================
We are scanning the string from left to right only once, hence the time complexity will be O(n).

b) Space : O(1)
============================
We are using Set as a data structure to facilitate our computation, therefore, the space complexity should also be O(n), right? Wrong!

WHY?

The problem clearly states that the string contains only English letters, digits, symbols and spaces and are covered in 256 code points.
Therefore, a string will be made up of a combination of these characters.

Since a Set can contain only unique elements, at any point the size of Set cannot be more than 256.

What does this mean? This means that the size of set is a function independent of the size of the input.
It is a constant.
Therefore, the space complexity will be O(1) (let me know in comments if you think otherwise).

####  [LC-424:Longest Repeating Character Replacement](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)
##### Solution Explanation:
```
Approach: Sliding Window Algorithm.
=================================================================================================================================================================
- The idea here is to find a window that satisfies the condition -
- count of most repeatable character + no. of allowed replacements <= length of the window
- Since the no. of allowed replacements is fixed, then the window size is directly proportional to the count of the most repeating character.
- Initially the window keeps growing from the end, until all the allowed replacements are added up in the window until it reaches the max size.
- The moment the condition is not satisfied (i.e., count of most repeatable character + no. of allowed replacements > size of the window), 
  then we need to slide the window (not shrink) 
  to the right and decrement the frequency of the character that is moved out of the window.
- If the next character coming in is the most repeating character, then the window grows or else it simply slides again.

####  [LC-76:Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/)
##### Solution Explanation:
```
Approach: Sliding Window Algorithm.
=================================================================================================================================================================
- The idea is we use a variable-length sliding window which is gradually applied across the string.
- We use two pointers: start and end to mark the sliding window.
- We start by fixing the start pointer and moving the end pointer to the right.
- The way we determine the current window is a valid one is by checking if all the target letters have been found in the current window.
- If we are in a valid sliding window, we first make note of the sliding window of the most minimum length we have seen so far.
- Next we try to contract the sliding window by moving the start pointer.
- If the sliding window continues to be valid, we note the new minimum sliding window. 
- If it becomes invalid (all letters of the target have been bypassed), 
  we break out of the inner loop and go back to moving the end pointer to the right.

- Simple question. Build a frequency map for s. Now check t against this frequency map.

####  [LC-49:Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/)
##### Solution Explanation:
```
Approach: HashMap
=================================================================================================================================================================
Algorithm
----------
Explanation
We loop through each input string and determine the frequency of each letter in it, considering all 26 English lowercase letters.
We transform the frequency list into a tuple which will then be used as a key to access the list of anagrams.
The given input string will then be appended to it.

For the python solution we use a dict where:
key: tuple of the frequency of 26 letters, value: [string].

For the kotlin soluton we use a Pair where:
encodeToPair encode strings to a pair of array of letters' frequencies and the string itself.
```
##### Complexity Analysis:
```
Time  : O(N)
Space : O(N)

n: The total number of letters.

Runtime Complexity
O(n) for examining each input letter once. The dictionary operations are expected to be in O(1).

##### Solution Explanation:
```
Approach: Stack
=================================================================================================================================================================
Algorithm
----------
- We can use a stack to keep track of the order of brackets seen in s and know whether the current bracket matches the last one seen.
- The stack will only contain openBrackets and we will use the openToCloseBracket mapping to check that the latest open bracket has a matching close bracket.
- I.e. The top of the stack (stack[-1]) should be an open bracket that matches the current close bracket, if the current bracket is a close bracket.
```

####  [LC-125:Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/)
##### Solution Explanation:
```
Approach: Two-Pointers
=================================================================================================================================================================
Algorithm
----------
- Normalize the string and convert to lowercase.
- Use 2 pointers start and end to compare characters.
- Skip non alphanumeric characters. Return False if characters do not match.
```
##### Complexity Analysis:
```
Time  : O(N)
Space : O(1)
=============================
Time Complexity  : O(N)
Since your checking every letter in the string. Because we move beg only to the right and end only to the left, until they meet.
Space Complexity : O(1)
We just use a couple of additional variables.
```
```python
def isPalindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    start, end = 0, len(s) - 1
    while start < end:
        if not s[start].isalnum():
            start += 1
        elif not s[end].isalnum():
            end -= 1
        elif s[start].lower() != s[end].lower():
            return False
        else:
            start += 1
            end -= 1
    return True

if __name__ == "__main__":
    #Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
    #Output: true
    #Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.    s = "()[]{}"
    s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
    print(isPalindrome(s))
```
```kotlin
fun isPalindrome(s: String): Boolean {
    var start = 0
    var end = s.length - 1
    while (true) {
        if (start >= end) return true
        if (!isAlnum(s[start])) {
            start++
        } else if (!isAlnum(s[end])) {
            end--
        } else if (!equal(s[start], s[end])) {
            return false
        } else {
            start++
            end--
        }
    }
	return true
}

fun equal(char1: Char, char2: Char): Boolean {
    return char1.toLowerCase() == char2.toLowerCase()
}

fun isAlnum(char: Char): Boolean {
    return char in '0'..'9' || char in 'a'..'z' || char in 'A'..'Z'
}

####  [LC-5:Longest Palindromic Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/)
##### Solution Explanation:
```
Approach: Manacher's Algorithm
=================================================================================================================================================================
There are many ways to solve this problem. Most common way is to treat each character of the string as the center and expand left and right.
Keep track of their lengths and return the string with maximum length.

So, what’s the problem 🤔? The problem is the time complexity - it will be O(n2). Not so good, right?

Let’s see what’s hurting us. We are expanding left and right treating each character as the center. 
What if we only expand only at the necessary characters instead of expanding at each character?

Can we do that 🤔? Yes, we can using the Manacher’s Algorithm. This algorithm intelligently uses characteristics 
of a palindrome to solve the problem in linear O(n) time -

1. The left side of a palindrome is a mirror image of its right side.
2. Odd length palindrome will be centered on a letter and even length palindrome will be centered in between 
the two letters (thus there will be total 2n + 1 centers).

Manacher’s Algorithm deals with the problem of finding the new center.
Below are the steps -

1. Initialize the lengths array to the number of possible centers.
2. Set the current center to the first center.
3. Loop while the current center is valid:
 (a) Expand to the left and right simultaneously until we find the largest palindrome around this center.
 (b) Fill in the appropriate entry in the longest palindrome lengths array.
 (c) Iterate through the longest palindrome lengths array backwards and 
     fill in the corresponding values to the right of the entry for the current center 
	 until an unknown value (as described above) is encountered.
 (d) set the new center to the index of this unknown value.
4. Return the longest substring.
```
##### Complexity Analysis:
```
Time Complexity  : O(N)
========================
Note that at each step of the algorithm we’re either incrementing our current position in the input string or filling in an entry 
in the lengths array. Since the lengths array has size linear in the size of the input array, 
the algorithm has worst-case linear O(N) running time.

Space Complexity : O(N)
========================
Since we are using the palindrome array to store the length of palindromes centered at each character,
the space complexity will also be O(N).

####  [LC-647:Palindromic Substrings](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindromic-substrings/)
##### Solution Explanation:
```
Approach: Manacher's Algorithm
=================================================================================================================================================================
ALGO:

1. Define formatted_string by adding # between characters, and @ at the beginning.
2. An array(palindrome_count) is used to mark the radius of the largest odd-length palindromic substring centered at index
3. Traverse throughout the length of the formatted string, and check for 3 basic conditions:
   i.   if the mirror is still in a valid position, update palindrome count for that index as minimum of current radius and expected mirror radius
   ii.  if the mirror is valid for all characters from the centre to the respective boundaries, keep updating the palindromic count
   iii. Shift the mirror if palindrome is found

####  [LC-271:Encode and Decode Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-and-decode-strings/)
##### Solution Explanation:
```
References: http://leetcode.libaoj.in/encode-and-decode-strings.html
            https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Transfer-Encoding
			https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunked_transfer_encoding
=================================================================================================================================================================
Approach: Chunked Transfer Encoding ( Similar to encoding used in HTTP v1.1 )
=================================================================================================================================================================
Pay attention to this approach because last year Google likes to ask that sort of low-level optimisation.
Serialize and deserialize BST problem is a similar example.

This approach is based on the encoding used in HTTP v1.1 . It doesn't depend on the set of input characters, 
and hence is more versatile and effective than Approach 1 [ Approach 1: Non-ASCII Delimiter ].

Data stream is divided into chunks. Each chunk is preceded by its size in bytes.

Encoding Algorithm
====================================================

        +---+---+---+ +---+---+ 
Input	| t | b | c | | d | e |
        +---+---+---+ +---+---+ 

Encode          Each chunk is preceded 
                by its 4-bytes size

+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 | t | b | c | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | d | e |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 
       \         /                 \          /
        \       /                   \        /
    size of next chunk               \      /
                                 size of next chunk

- Iterate over the array of chunks, i.e. strings.
  + For each chunk compute its length, and convert that length into 4-bytes string.
  + Append to encoded string :
    [] 4-bytes string with information about chunk size in bytes.
    [] Chunk itself.

- Return encoded string.

Decoding Algorithm
====================================================

        +---+---+---+ +---+---+ 
Input	| t | b | c | | d | e |
        +---+---+---+ +---+---+ 

----------------------------------------------------------------

Encode          Each chunk is preceded 
                by its 4-bytes size

+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 | t | b | c | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | d | e |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 
       \         /                 \          /
        \       /                   \        /
    size of next chunk               \      /
                                 size of next chunk

----------------------------------------------------------------

Decode             1. Read next chunk length
                   2. Read chunk itself and add it to output


        +---+---+---+ +---+---+ 
	| t | b | c | | d | e |
        +---+---+---+ +---+---+ 

- Iterate over the encoded string with a pointer i initiated as 0. While i < n :
  + Read 4 bytes s[i: i + 4] . It's chunk size in bytes. Convert this 4-bytes string to integer length .
  + Move the pointer by 4 bytes i += 4 .
  + Append to the decoded array string s[i: i + length] .
  + Move the pointer by length bytes i += length .
- Return decoded array of strings.
```
##### Complexity Analysis:
```
Time Complexity  : O(N)
========================
O(N) both for encode and decode, where N is a number of strings in the input array.

Space Complexity : O(1)
========================
O(1) for encode to keep the output, since the output is one string.O(N) for decode keep the output, since the output is an array of strings.

####  [LC-104:Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/)
##### Solution Explanation:
```
1) Depth First Search: Post Order
- Empty tree i.e. root is None: Depth = 0
- maxDepth(root) = max(maxDepth(root.left), maxDepth(root.right)) + 1
- Time and Space Complexity: O(N)

2) Depth First Search: PreOrder
- Perform pre-order traversal and pass a variable to track the level
- Time and Space Complexity: O(N)

3) Depth First Search: Iterative Version
- Push the root and the level on the stack.
- Pop and push left and right kids of root. Update the max_level variable.
- Time and Space Complexity: O(N)

4) Breadth First Search: Iterative Version
- At every level, "queue" ends up being a list of all the nodes at that level.
  We increase the depth till the time "queue" is an empty list.
- Time and Space Complexity: O(N)
```
##### Complexity Analysis:
```
TC: O(N)
SC: O(N)

TC: Best case O(logN)
    Worst case O(N)
	
so typically between O(N) and O(logN)

SC:  Best case O(logN)
     Worst case O(N)

so typically between O(N) and O(logN)
	
In the worst case, the tree is completely unbalanced, e.g. each node has only left child node, 
the recursion call would occur N times (the height of the tree), therefore the storage to keep the call stack would be O(N).
But in the best case (the tree is completely balanced), the height of the tree would be log(N).
Therefore, the space complexity in this case would be O(log(N)).

NOTE: big-O complexity is asking for the worst case.

####  [LC-100:Same Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/)
##### Solution Explanation:
```
###########
Approach-1 : Recursion
###########
---------------
Intuition
---------------
The simplest strategy here is to use recursion. Check if p and q nodes are not None, and their values are equal.
If all checks are OK, do the same for the child nodes recursively.

###########
Approach-2 : Iterative
###########
---------------
Intuition
---------------

Start from the root and then at each iteration pop the current node out of the deque. Then do the same checks as in the approach 1 :

 * p and p are not None,
 * p.val is equal to q.val,

and if checks are OK, push the child nodes.
```
##### Complexity Analysis:
```
###########
Approach-1 : Recursion
###########
Time complexity  : O(N)

                   where N is a number of nodes in the tree, since one visits each node exactly once.

Space complexity : O(N)

                   O(log(N)) in the best case of completely balanced tree and O(N) in the worst case of completely unbalanced tree, 
                   to keep a recursion stack.
